In **Structured Streaming** in Apache Spark, when writing data to an external sink (like a file, database, or message queue), the **output mode** specifies how the output data is written and how the previous results are handled. Spark supports three output modes for data streams:

1. **Complete**
2. **Append**
3. **Update**

Each output mode has its own characteristics, which are described below.

### 1. **Complete Output Mode**

- **Definition**: In the **complete** output mode, the entire result table is recomputed and written to the output sink every time a new trigger occurs. This means that for every batch of data processed, Spark will overwrite the previous output with the entire result.
  
- **When to Use**: The **complete** mode is suitable when the result is small enough to be recomputed every time, and you want the output to reflect the current state of the entire data set (e.g., aggregations that require all data).

- **Examples of Use Cases**:
  - **Aggregations**: For example, if you are calculating the sum of sales over time, the result might change with each new batch of data.
  - **Global State**: Any scenario where you need to maintain and output the current state of the entire data set.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Recomputes the full result** every time.
  - **Overwrites the output** with the new result after each trigger.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Write stream with Complete mode
  df.writeStream \
    .outputMode("complete") \
    .format("console") \
    .start()
  ```

### 2. **Append Output Mode**

- **Definition**: In the **append** output mode, only the new data since the last trigger is written to the output sink. The previously written data remains in the sink, and only new records are appended.

- **When to Use**: The **append** mode is suitable for cases where you are continuously adding data, and the results do not require updates to the already outputted data (e.g., for streaming logs or metrics).

- **Examples of Use Cases**:
  - **Logs**: If you are writing log entries to a file or database, you typically only add new logs.
  - **Real-time metrics**: For example, counting the number of users visiting a website, where you only want to append the latest counts.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Only new data** is added to the output.
  - **Does not update previous results**.
  - Suitable for use cases like streaming logs, simple counters, etc.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Write stream with Append mode
  df.writeStream \
    .outputMode("append") \
    .format("console") \
    .start()
  ```

### 3. **Update Output Mode**

- **Definition**: The **update** output mode writes only the updated rows since the last trigger. This mode is useful when you need to update the results of a streaming query but want to avoid recalculating the entire output as in **complete** mode.

- **When to Use**: The **update** mode is used when only certain rows of data need to be updated, for example, when performing aggregation and only the result of the aggregations needs to be updated.

- **Examples of Use Cases**:
  - **Incremental updates**: For example, when updating the running total or average of data.
  - **Changing states**: If a query needs to compute the difference between consecutive values.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Only updated data** is written to the sink.
  - **Does not overwrite or append** full results; it just updates the rows that have changed since the last trigger.
  
- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Write stream with Update mode
  df.writeStream \
    .outputMode("update") \
    .format("console") \
    .start()
  ```

### **Comparison of the Output Modes**

| **Mode**      | **Data Written**               | **Use Case**                              | **Performance**          |
|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Complete**  | Entire result (overwrites previous output) | Aggregations, when you need the full result every time | Can be resource-intensive for large data |
| **Append**    | Only new data                  | Continuous data streams, logs, metrics    | Most efficient for appending data |
| **Update**    | Only updated rows              | Aggregations or windowed operations where only changes matter | Efficient, but not as much as append mode |

### **When to Use Which Mode?**

- **Complete mode** should be used when you want to **recompute the entire result** (e.g., after a large change in the stream or in case of stateful operations like aggregations).
- **Append mode** should be used when the result **only grows over time** and previous results are irrelevant (e.g., new entries or logs).
- **Update mode** is suitable when the result changes incrementally and you **only need the updated rows** rather than the entire result.

### **Example of Aggregation with Different Modes**

Consider a streaming dataset where we are counting the number of occurrences of different words in a stream of text:

#### Complete Mode (Full Aggregation):
```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Sample data (streaming)
df = spark.readStream.text("path/to/input")

# Count word occurrences
word_counts = df.select(F.explode(F.split(df.value, " ")).alias("word")) \
                .groupBy("word") \
                .count()

# Output with Complete mode (full result)
word_counts.writeStream \
    .outputMode("complete") \
    .format("console") \
    .start()
```

In **complete mode**, the entire count of words would be printed every time new data arrives, meaning every batch will output the **full count** of each word across all batches.

#### Append Mode (New Records):
```python
word_counts.writeStream \
    .outputMode("append") \
    .format("console") \
    .start()
```

In **append mode**, only the **new word counts** (i.e., words that appeared in the most recent batch) will be written.

#### Update Mode (Updated Counts):
```python
word_counts.writeStream \
    .outputMode("update") \
    .format("console") \
    .start()
```

In **update mode**, only the **updated counts** of words will be written, meaning only the words whose counts have changed will be output.

### **Conclusion**
- **Complete** mode: Recomputes the entire result and overwrites it.
- **Append** mode: Adds only new data, suitable for logs or incremental counts.
- **Update** mode: Writes only the updated data (changed rows), useful for incremental stateful processing.
