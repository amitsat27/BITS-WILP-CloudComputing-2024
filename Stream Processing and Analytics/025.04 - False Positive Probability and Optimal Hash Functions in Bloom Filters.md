### **False Positive Probability (FPP) in Bloom Filters**

**Definition**:  
False positive probability (FPP) measures the likelihood that a Bloom filter incorrectly identifies an element as being present in a set when it is not. This happens due to overlapping bit positions set by multiple elements.

---

### **Key Formula for FPP**

```math
\text{FPP} = \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)^{kn}\right)^k
```

Where:  
- \( m \): Total number of bits in the Bloom filter.  
- \( n \): Number of elements inserted into the filter.  
- \( k \): Number of hash functions.  

#### Simplified Insights:
- **Higher \( m \)** (more bits) reduces FPP because collisions are less likely.
- **Higher \( k \)** initially reduces FPP but starts to increase it after an optimal point due to increased overlaps.

---

### **Example 1: Calculating FPP**

#### Scenario:
You have a Bloom filter with:
- \( m = 1000 \) bits,
- \( n = 100 \) elements,
- \( k = 5 \) hash functions.

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. Probability of a bit being unset by one hash function for one element:
   ```math
   P_\text{unset\_1} = 1 - \frac{1}{m} = 1 - \frac{1}{1000} = 0.999
   ```

2. Probability of the bit being unset after all \( k \) hash functions:
   ```math
   P_\text{unset\_k} = \left(1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)^k = (0.999)^5 = 0.995
   ```

3. Probability of the bit remaining unset after \( n \) elements:
   ```math
   P_\text{unset\_n} = \left(1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)^{kn} = (0.995)^{500} \approx 0.082
   ```

4. Probability of the bit being set:
   ```math
   P_\text{set} = 1 - P_\text{unset\_n} = 1 - 0.082 = 0.918
   ```

5. FPP:
   ```math
   \text{FPP} = P_\text{set}^k = (0.918)^5 \approx 0.65
   ```

**Result**: The false positive probability is approximately **65%**, which is quite high. Increasing \( m \) or adjusting \( k \) can reduce this.

---

### **Example 2: Reducing FPP**

#### Scenario:
Suppose we double the bit array size to \( m = 2000 \) while keeping \( n = 100 \) and \( k = 5 \).

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. Probability of a bit being unset after all \( k \) hash functions and \( n \) elements:
   ```math
   P_\text{unset\_n} = \left(1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)^{kn} = (1 - \frac{1}{2000})^{500} \approx 0.398
   ```

2. Probability of the bit being set:
   ```math
   P_\text{set} = 1 - 0.398 = 0.602
   ```

3. FPP:
  ```math
   \text{FPP} = P_\text{set}^k = (0.602)^5 \approx 0.08
   ```

**Result**: By doubling \( m \), the FPP is reduced to **8%**.

---

### **Optimal Hash Functions**

**Definition**:  
The optimal number of hash functions \( k \) minimizes FPP for a given \( m \) and \( n \). The formula for the optimal \( k \) is:

```math
k = \frac{m}{n} \ln 2
```

Where:  
- \( m \): Total bits in the Bloom filter.  
- \( n \): Number of inserted elements.  

---

### **Example 1: Optimal \( k \) Calculation**

#### Scenario:
You have \( m = 1000 \) bits and \( n = 100 \) elements.

#### Calculation:
1. Calculate \( \frac{m}{n} \):
   ```math
   \frac{m}{n} = \frac{1000}{100} = 10
   ```

2. Multiply by \( \ln 2 \) (approximately \( 0.693 \)):
   ```math
   k = 10 \cdot 0.693 = 6.93
   ```

3. Round to the nearest integer:
   ```math
   k = 7
   ```

**Result**: The optimal number of hash functions is **7**.

---

### **Example 2: Adjusting \( k \)**

#### Scenario:
If you reduce \( m \) to \( 500 \) bits while keeping \( n = 100 \), calculate the new \( k \).

#### Calculation:
1. Calculate \( \frac{m}{n} \):
   ```math
   \frac{m}{n} = \frac{500}{100} = 5
   ```

2. Multiply by \( \ln 2 \):
   ```math
   k = 5 \cdot 0.693 = 3.465
   ```

3. Round to the nearest integer:
   ```math
   k = 3
   ```

**Result**: The optimal number of hash functions is now **3**.

---

### **Key Insights**
1. **FPP** is influenced by \( m \), \( n \), and \( k \). Increasing \( m \) or optimizing \( k \) can significantly reduce false positives.
2. The **optimal \( k \)** balances minimizing overlap and avoiding unnecessary computation. Too many or too few hash functions increase FPP.
3. Practical systems choose \( m \) and \( k \) to achieve a balance between memory use and acceptable FPP for specific applications.
