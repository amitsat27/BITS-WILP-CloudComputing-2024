### **HyperLogLog (HLL): Overview**

**HyperLogLog** is a **probabilistic data structure** used to estimate the **cardinality** (number of unique elements) in a large dataset. It provides a highly memory-efficient way to approximate the count of unique elements, making it suitable for big data and streaming applications.

---

### **Key Features of HyperLogLog:**

1. **Memory Efficient**: Uses fixed memory size regardless of data size.
2. **Fast Approximation**: Provides fast results with acceptable accuracy.
3. **Probabilistic**: Trades exactness for efficiency.
4. **Accuracy**: Achieves **relative error of ~1.04 / √m** where `m` is the number of registers.
5. **Widely Used**: Common in big data systems like **Spark**, **Redis**, and **Presto** for approximate distinct counts.

---

### **Where HyperLogLog is Used:**

- Counting unique visitors to a website.
- Estimating the number of distinct IP addresses in a network.
- Cardinality estimation in streaming data.
- Analyzing social media engagements (e.g., unique hashtags).
- Distributed systems and databases (e.g., Redis, Google BigQuery).

## **HyperLogLog Algorithm**

### Basic Idea:

HyperLogLog works on the principle of:

1. **Hashing**: Convert elements into a uniformly random hash.
2. **Zero Runs**: Use the position of the leftmost '1' bit in the binary hash to estimate the cardinality.
3. **Registers**: Split the hash space into multiple **registers** to increase accuracy.
4. **Aggregation**: Combine multiple estimates using a harmonic mean.

---

### **Steps in the Algorithm**:

1. **Hashing**:
   - Use a hash function `h(x)` that maps an element `x` to a fixed-length binary string.

2. **Divide into Buckets**:
   - Divide the hash space into **m buckets** (registers) using the first `log2(m)` bits of the hash.

3. **Count Leading Zeros**:
   - In each bucket, count the number of leading zeros (`ρ`) after the index bits.

4. **Update Registers**:
   - Update the corresponding bucket/register with the **maximum value** of `ρ + 1`.

5. **Estimate Cardinality**:
   - Use the harmonic mean of all registers to approximate the unique count.
   - Apply correction factors for bias.

### **Mathematical Formula for Cardinality Estimation**

If \( m \) is the number of registers and \( M = \{M_1, M_2, ..., M_m\} \) is the set of register values, then the cardinality \( E \) is estimated as:

$$
E = \alpha_m \cdot m^2 \cdot \left( \sum_{i=1}^m 2^{-M_i} \right)^{-1}
$$

Where:
- \( \alpha_m \) is a bias correction constant.
- \( M_i \) is the value of the \( i^{th} \) register.

For small cardinalities, further corrections are applied to ensure better accuracy.

### **Pseudo Code for HyperLogLog**

```plaintext
Function HyperLogLog(data, m):
    Initialize m registers R[1..m] to 0
    α = biasCorrectionFactor(m)
    
    For each element x in data:
        hash_value = HashFunction(x)
        bucket = First log2(m) bits of hash_value
        remaining_bits = Remaining bits after bucket
        ρ = CountLeadingZeros(remaining_bits) + 1
        R[bucket] = max(R[bucket], ρ)
    
    # Harmonic mean of register values
    Z = sum(2^(-R[i]) for i in 1..m)
    E = α * m^2 / Z
    
    # Small range correction
    If E <= 2.5 * m:
        V = countZeroRegisters(R)
        If V > 0:
            E = m * log(m / V)
    
    # Large range correction (optional)
    If E > threshold:
        Apply large cardinality correction
    
    Return E
```

### **Examples of HyperLogLog**

#### **Example 1: Counting Unique Visitors**

Let’s assume we want to count the number of unique visitors (IP addresses) to a website.

- Dataset:  
  ```
  IP Addresses = [192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.1, 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.1]
  ```

1. **Hash the IP Addresses**:
   - Use a hash function (e.g., MurmurHash) to convert each IP address to a binary string.

2. **Split into Registers**:
   - Divide the hash space into `m = 16` registers.

3. **Count Leading Zeros**:
   - For each hash, count the number of leading zeros in the binary representation after the index bits.

4. **Update Registers**:
   - Update the registers with the maximum number of leading zeros observed for each bucket.

5. **Estimate Cardinality**:
   - Use the formula to calculate the cardinality.

**Result**: HyperLogLog estimates the number of unique IP addresses as approximately **4**.

#### **Example 2: Counting Unique Hashtags**

Let’s say we are analyzing social media posts for unique hashtags.

- Dataset:  
  ```
  Hashtags = ['#AI', '#BigData', '#Spark', '#AI', '#Streaming', '#BigData']
  ```

**Steps**:

1. **Hashing**: Convert each hashtag to a hash value:
   - `#AI` → `101011...`
   - `#BigData` → `110001...`
   - `#Spark` → `111010...`
   - `#Streaming` → `100101...`

2. **Divide into Registers**:
   - Use the first 4 bits of the hash to determine the register (m = 16).

3. **Count Leading Zeros**:
   - For each remaining part of the hash, count leading zeros and update the registers.

4. **Estimate**:
   - Using the harmonic mean of the registers, estimate the cardinality.

**Result**: HyperLogLog approximates the number of unique hashtags as **4**.

### **Advantages of HyperLogLog**

1. **Memory Efficient**: Fixed memory usage even for very large datasets.
2. **Scalable**: Suitable for distributed systems.
3. **Fast**: Quick computations for approximate counts.
4. **Accuracy**: Provides reliable approximations with low error rates.

---

### **Limitations**

1. **Approximation**: HyperLogLog does not provide exact counts.
2. **Bias in Small Data**: Accuracy decreases for very small cardinalities.
3. **Hash Function Dependency**: The accuracy depends on the quality of the hash function.

---

### **Conclusion**

HyperLogLog is a powerful and memory-efficient probabilistic algorithm for estimating cardinality (unique elements) in large datasets. It is widely used in **streaming analytics**, **distributed computing**, and big data systems where exact counting is impractical due to memory and performance constraints.

By hashing data, dividing the hash space into registers, and counting leading zeros, HyperLogLog provides approximate unique counts with excellent space efficiency.
