### **Streaming Data Decaying Window Explanation**

The **decaying window** algorithm is used to track trends in a data stream by assigning decaying weights to older elements while giving higher importance to recent ones. It allows the system to:

1. Focus on **recent trends** while discounting older elements.
2. Handle **noisy data** effectively by de-emphasizing spikes or outliers.

### **Algorithm Details**

For an incoming data stream, we:
1. **Assign a weight** of $\( 1 \)$ to each new element.
2. **Reduce the weight** of all existing elements by a constant factor $\( (1 - c) \)$, where $\( c \)$ is a small constant like $\( 0.1 \)$ (decay rate).
3. **Calculate aggregate scores** for distinct elements using the formula:  
```math
   \text{Score}_{t} = \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} a_{t-1} \cdot (1-c)^i
```
   Here:
   - $\( a_{t-1} \)$: Weight of the element at position $\( t-1 \)$ in the sequence.
   - $\( c \)$: Decay constant.
   - $\( (1-c)^i \)$: Weight decay factor for an element $\( i \)$ steps behind the current position.

### **Final Results**

1. **FIFA**: Final score is **2.187541**.  
2. **IPL**: Final score is **3.02949**.  

---

### **Insights**
Using this summation formula clearly shows how each element's score decays over time while incorporating new weights dynamically. **IPL** has a higher score because of its higher recency and frequency.

---

### **Insights**
- **IPL** has a higher score due to its higher frequency in recent events, making it the "most trending" or "popular" element in this stream.  
- **Decaying weights** naturally discount the impact of older occurrences, ensuring the system reacts quickly to changes in trends.
