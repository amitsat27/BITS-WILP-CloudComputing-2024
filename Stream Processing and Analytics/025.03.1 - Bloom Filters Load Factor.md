The **load factor** in a **Bloom Filter** refers to the ratio of the number of bits set to 1 in the bit array relative to the total size of the bit array. It measures how "full" the Bloom Filter has become.

A higher load factor increases the **probability of false positives** because more bits are set, which makes it more likely that a query (check for membership) will match bits that are already set by other elements.

---

## **Definition of Load Factor**

The load factor \( \alpha \) of a Bloom Filter is defined as:

$$
\alpha = \frac{\text{Number of bits set to 1}}{\text{Total number of bits in the bit array}}
$$

---

## **Factors Affecting the Load Factor**

1. **Number of Elements Inserted** (\( n \)):  
   The more elements you insert, the higher the load factor.

2. **Bit Array Size** (\( m \)):  
   A larger bit array allows for lower load factors, reducing the chances of false positives.

3. **Number of Hash Functions** (\( k \)):  
   Each inserted element sets \( k \) bits, so the load factor increases faster with a higher number of hash functions.

---

## **Formula for Load Factor**

Given:
- \( n \) = Number of elements inserted,
- \( m \) = Size of the bit array (in bits),
- \( k \) = Number of hash functions,

The probability that a particular bit remains **0** after inserting \( n \) elements is:

$$
P(\text{bit remains 0}) = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^{kn}
$$

Thus, the probability that a bit is **1** (load factor \( \alpha \)) is:

$$
\alpha = 1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^{kn}
$$

For large \( m \) and small \( kn/m \), this can be approximated as:

$$
\alpha \approx 1 - e^{-kn/m}
$$

---

## **Example: Calculating Load Factor**

Suppose:
- \( m = 1000 \) (size of bit array),
- \( k = 3 \) (number of hash functions),
- \( n = 50 \) (number of elements inserted).

Using the formula:

1. Compute \( kn/m \):

$$
\frac{kn}{m} = \frac{3 \times 50}{1000} = 0.15
$$

2. Plug into the approximation for the load factor:

$$
\alpha \approx 1 - e^{-0.15}
$$

Using \( e^{-0.15} \approx 0.8607 \):

$$
\alpha \approx 1 - 0.8607 = 0.1393
$$

Thus, the load factor is approximately **13.93%**.

---

## **Implications of Load Factor**

1. **Lower Load Factor**:
   - Fewer bits set to 1.
   - Lower false positive rate.

2. **Higher Load Factor**:
   - More bits set to 1.
   - Increased false positive rate.

---

## **Optimal Load Factor**

The optimal choice of \( k \) (number of hash functions) and \( m \) (bit array size) minimizes the false positive rate for a given number of elements \( n \). The false positive rate can be expressed as:

$$
\text{False Positive Rate} = \left( 1 - e^{-kn/m} \right)^k
$$

Choosing the optimal \( k \) gives the best trade-off between load factor and false positives.

---

## **Conclusion**

The load factor measures how full the Bloom Filter bit array is. A higher load factor increases the likelihood of false positives. By adjusting the size of the bit array \( m \) and the number of hash functions \( k \), we can control the load factor and optimize Bloom Filter performance.
