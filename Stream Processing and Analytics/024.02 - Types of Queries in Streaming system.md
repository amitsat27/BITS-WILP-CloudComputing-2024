### **Types of Queries in Streaming Systems**

In streaming systems, queries define how data is processed and transformed as it flows through the system. They are categorized into **ad-hoc queries** and **continuous queries**, each suited for specific use cases based on the nature and requirements of the task.

### **1. Ad-hoc Queries**

#### **Definition**:
- **Ad-hoc queries** are **one-time** or **on-demand** queries executed to analyze or inspect a snapshot of streaming data.
- Typically used for exploratory analysis or troubleshooting.

#### **Characteristics**:
- **One-time Execution**: Runs once and produces results based on the current state of the data.
- **Latency**: Results are obtained immediately after the query finishes processing.
- **Use Case**: Provides insights into a specific point in time or event in the stream.

#### **Examples**:
1. Querying the latest batch of streaming logs for error codes.
2. Fetching the top-selling product in the last hour from a stream of sales transactions.
3. Inspecting the number of failed transactions in the past 5 minutes.

#### **Example in Spark Structured Streaming**:
```scala
val streamDF = spark.readStream
  .format("kafka")
  .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092")
  .option("subscribe", "topic")
  .load()

// Run an ad-hoc query on a snapshot of streaming data
streamDF.createOrReplaceTempView("streaming_view")
spark.sql("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM streaming_view WHERE value LIKE '%ERROR%'").show()
```

### **2. Continuous Queries**

#### **Definition**:
- **Continuous queries** are **persistent** queries that run indefinitely, processing and updating results as new data arrives.
- Ideal for **real-time** monitoring and reporting.

#### **Characteristics**:
- **Persistent Execution**: Executes continuously and updates results dynamically.
- **Low Latency**: Provides near real-time results for each incoming data point or batch.
- **Stateful Processing**: Can maintain state for long-running operations like aggregations or joins.
- **Output Modes**: Append, Update, Complete.

#### **Examples**:
1. Monitoring website traffic in real-time by counting hits per second.
2. Detecting fraud by continuously analyzing transaction streams.
3. Aggregating sensor readings from IoT devices to calculate hourly averages.

#### **Example in Spark Structured Streaming**:
```scala
val streamDF = spark.readStream
  .format("kafka")
  .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092")
  .option("subscribe", "topic")
  .load()

// Continuous query for real-time word count
val wordCounts = streamDF.selectExpr("CAST(value AS STRING)").as[String]
  .flatMap(_.split(" "))
  .groupBy("value")
  .count()

val query = wordCounts.writeStream
  .outputMode("update")
  .format("console")
  .start()

query.awaitTermination()
```

### **Comparison: Ad-hoc vs. Continuous Queries**

| **Aspect**                | **Ad-hoc Queries**                              | **Continuous Queries**                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Execution Duration**    | One-time                                         | Persistent                                   |
| **Latency**               | Snapshot-based; not real-time                   | Near real-time                               |
| **Use Case**              | Exploratory analysis, debugging                 | Real-time monitoring, reporting              |
| **Statefulness**          | Typically stateless                             | Often stateful (e.g., windowed aggregations) |
| **Examples**              | Fetching recent errors, inspecting logs         | Monitoring traffic, real-time fraud detection |

### **When to Use Each Type?**

| **Scenario**                             | **Recommended Query Type**            |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Debugging or troubleshooting**         | Ad-hoc Queries                        |
| **Exploring patterns in recent data**    | Ad-hoc Queries                        |
| **Monitoring system metrics**            | Continuous Queries                    |
| **Building dashboards**                  | Continuous Queries                    |
| **Alerting on anomalies**                | Continuous Queries                    |
