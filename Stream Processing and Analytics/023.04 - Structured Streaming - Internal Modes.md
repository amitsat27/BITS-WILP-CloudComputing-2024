Apache Spark **Structured Streaming** supports **two internal modes** for processing streaming data:

1. **Micro-Batch Mode**  
2. **Continuous Processing Mode**

These modes determine how Spark processes incoming data and impacts latency, throughput, and execution semantics.

---

## **1. Micro-Batch Mode** (Default Mode)

### **Description**:
- In **Micro-Batch Mode**, streaming data is processed as a series of small, discrete **batches**.
- Incoming data is grouped into micro-batches, and Spark processes each batch sequentially.
- This mode uses the same **Spark SQL engine** that processes batch workloads, enabling optimizations like **Catalyst optimizer** and **Tungsten engine**.

### **Key Features**:
- **Latency**: Typically low (millisecond-to-seconds scale) but not real-time.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Achieves **exactly-once semantics** using **checkpointing** and **write-ahead logs (WAL)**.
- **Ease of Use**: Unified API for batch and streaming makes it easy to manage.
- **Windowed Aggregations**: Supports advanced aggregations like tumbling, sliding, and session windows.

### **Use Case**:
- Suitable for workloads that require near-real-time processing with low-latency tolerances (e.g., ETL pipelines, dashboard updates).

### **How to Use**:
Micro-Batch Mode is **enabled by default** in Structured Streaming. No special configuration is required.

#### Example:
```python
query = (df.writeStream
            .outputMode("append")
            .format("console")
            .start())
query.awaitTermination()
```

## **2. Continuous Processing Mode** (Experimental)

### **Description**:
- **Continuous Processing Mode** aims for **true low-latency streaming** with processing times as low as **1 millisecond**.
- Unlike Micro-Batch Mode, it processes data **continuously** as it arrives, without waiting for micro-batch boundaries.

### **Key Features**:
- **Latency**: Ultra-low latency (milliseconds scale).
- **Processing Semantics**: Achieves **exactly-once semantics** even in continuous processing.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Fault tolerance is achieved via **checkpointing**.
- **Continuous Execution**: Continuous streaming jobs run perpetually without interruptions between micro-batches.

### **Limitations**:
- Limited API support compared to Micro-Batch Mode.
- Only **append output mode** is supported (no support for updates or complete output mode).
- Does not support complex aggregations or stateful operations like windowing.

### **Use Case**:
- Ideal for applications requiring extremely low latency (e.g., financial fraud detection, real-time sensor data analysis).

### **How to Use**:
To enable Continuous Processing Mode, set the option `trigger=Continuous` with a checkpoint interval.

#### Example:
```python
query = (df.writeStream
            .outputMode("append")
            .format("console")
            .trigger(continuous="1 second")  # Continuous mode with a checkpoint interval of 1 second
            .start())
query.awaitTermination()
```

## **Comparison: Micro-Batch Mode vs Continuous Processing Mode**

| Feature                    | **Micro-Batch Mode**           | **Continuous Processing Mode**         |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Processing Granularity** | Micro-batches (small batches)  | Continuous (row-by-row)               |
| **Latency**                | Low (seconds to milliseconds) | Ultra-low (sub-millisecond)           |
| **Fault Tolerance**        | Exactly-once semantics         | Exactly-once semantics                |
| **Output Modes**           | Append, Update, Complete       | Only Append                           |
| **Stateful Operations**    | Supported (e.g., windowing)    | Not fully supported                   |
| **API Support**            | Full API support               | Limited API support                   |
| **Use Case**               | Near real-time applications    | Ultra-low-latency applications        |

## **Summary**

- **Micro-Batch Mode** is the default, mature mode suitable for most streaming workloads.
- **Continuous Processing Mode** is experimental and designed for ultra-low-latency use cases but has limitations in API and functionality.

For most production workloads, **Micro-Batch Mode** is preferred due to its versatility and robustness, while **Continuous Processing Mode** can be explored for latency-sensitive applications.
