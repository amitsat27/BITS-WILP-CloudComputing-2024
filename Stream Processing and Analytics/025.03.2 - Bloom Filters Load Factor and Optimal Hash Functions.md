The **load factor** and the **optimal number of hash functions** in a **Bloom Filter** are closely related because they both influence the **false positive rate**. A Bloom Filter aims to balance the number of bits in the array, the number of hash functions, and the number of elements to minimize the false positive rate while keeping memory usage efficient.

### **Key Concepts:**
1. **Load Factor (\(\alpha\))**:
   The load factor is the fraction of bits set to 1 in the Bloom Filter's bit array. It is a direct consequence of the number of elements inserted and the size of the bit array.
   
   $$ \alpha = \frac{\text{Number of bits set to 1}}{\text{Total number of bits in the bit array}} $$

2. **Optimal Number of Hash Functions (\(k_{\text{opt}}\))**:
   The optimal number of hash functions is the number of hash functions that minimizes the **false positive rate** for a given **load factor** and bit array size.

### **Relationship Between Load Factor and Optimal Hash Functions**

The **false positive probability** of a Bloom Filter can be expressed as:

$$
P(\text{false positive}) = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^{kn}
$$

Where:
- \(m\) = size of the bit array,
- \(k\) = number of hash functions,
- \(n\) = number of elements inserted.

The goal is to minimize the false positive rate while keeping the **load factor** manageable. To do this, the number of hash functions \(k\) should be chosen in such a way that it minimizes the false positive rate for a given load factor.

#### **Optimal Number of Hash Functions**

The **optimal number of hash functions** \(k_{\text{opt}}\) that minimizes the false positive rate is approximately:

$$
k_{\text{opt}} = \frac{m}{n} \ln(2)
$$

Where:
- \( m \) = number of bits in the array,
- \( n \) = number of elements inserted.

This choice of \( k_{\text{opt}} \) strikes a balance between having too few hash functions (which would cause some buckets to be overly congested and increase the false positive rate) and too many hash functions (which would waste bit array space).

### **Load Factor and Hash Functions Interaction**

Now, let’s look at the relationship between the **load factor** and the **optimal number of hash functions**:

1. **Load Factor (\(\alpha\))**:
   The load factor can be expressed as:
   $$
   \alpha = 1 - e^{-kn/m}
   $$

   The load factor depends on both the number of elements \(n\) and the number of hash functions \(k\). When the **number of hash functions increases**, the number of bits set to 1 increases, leading to a higher load factor.

2. **When \(k_{\text{opt}}\) is used**:
   - With the **optimal number of hash functions** \(k_{\text{opt}}\), the **load factor** will stabilize at a point where the false positive rate is minimized.
   - If \(k\) is too large, the load factor will increase, and the number of hash collisions will rise, leading to higher false positive rates.

### **Impact on False Positive Rate**

The **false positive rate** \(FPR\) is related to both the number of hash functions and the load factor:

- For a fixed **load factor** (which is determined by the number of elements inserted \(n\) and bit array size \(m\)), the **false positive rate** will decrease with an optimal choice of \(k_{\text{opt}}\).
  
### **Example:**

Let’s say we have:
- \(m = 1000\) (bit array size),
- \(n = 100\) (number of elements inserted).

**Step 1: Calculate the optimal number of hash functions**:

Using the formula for \(k_{\text{opt}}\):

$$
k_{\text{opt}} = \frac{m}{n} \ln(2) = \frac{1000}{100} \ln(2) \approx 7
$$

Thus, the optimal number of hash functions is approximately 7.

**Step 2: Determine the load factor with this optimal \(k\)**:

Using the load factor formula:

$$
\alpha = 1 - e^{-k_{\text{opt}} \cdot n / m} = 1 - e^{-7 \cdot 100 / 1000} \approx 1 - e^{-0.7} \approx 0.498
$$

So, the load factor is about **49.8%**, meaning nearly half of the bit array is set to 1.

**Step 3: Compute the false positive rate**:

The **false positive rate** with the optimal \(k\) is:

$$
FPR = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^{k_{\text{opt}} \cdot n} \approx \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1000} \right)^{7 \cdot 100} \approx 0.0104
$$

Thus, the false positive rate is around **1.04%**.

### **Conclusion**

- **Load factor** and **optimal hash functions** are directly related: the optimal choice of hash functions minimizes the false positive rate and keeps the load factor balanced.
- The **load factor increases** as you insert more elements or use too many hash functions.
- The **optimal number of hash functions** minimizes the false positive rate for a given size of the Bloom Filter.
- By carefully adjusting the number of hash functions and monitoring the load factor, we can design efficient Bloom Filters that strike a good balance between memory usage and false positive probability.
