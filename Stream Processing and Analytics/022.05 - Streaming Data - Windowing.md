### **Streaming Data - Windowing with Policies and Types**

In streaming systems, **windowing** is a key concept for managing and processing unbounded streams of data. Windowing divides continuous data streams into manageable chunks for aggregation or computation. These chunks are governed by **policies** (like triggers and eviction) and categorized into various **types**.

---

### **1. Windowing Policies**

#### **1.1 Trigger Policy**  
Defines **when** the results of a window are emitted.

- **Default Behavior**:  
  Results are emitted at the end of the window by default.
  
- **Custom Triggers**:
  - **Time-Based Trigger**: Emit results at regular time intervals.
    - Example: Emit results every 5 seconds.
  - **Count-Based Trigger**: Emit results after a specified number of events.
    - Example: Emit after processing 100 events.
  - **Early Trigger**: Emit interim results before the window ends.
    - Example: Emit partial counts every second in a 10-second window.
  - **Late Trigger**: Allow late-arriving events to update results after the window closes.
    - Example: Emit updates for up to 2 minutes after the window ends.

---

#### **1.2 Eviction Policy**  
Defines **when events are removed** from a window.

- **Time-Based Eviction**:
  - Remove events older than a specific time.
  - Example: Retain events from the last 5 minutes.

- **Count-Based Eviction**:
  - Remove events once the window contains more than a set number.
  - Example: Retain only the last 100 events.

- **Custom Eviction**:
  - Use application-specific rules to remove events.
  - Example: Evict events based on a priority or condition.

### **2. Window Types**

#### **2.1 Tumbling Window**  
Non-overlapping fixed-size windows that process events occurring within the windowâ€™s duration.

- **Temporal Tumbling Window**:  
  - Based on **time intervals**.
  - Example: A 1-minute tumbling window will process all events from `12:00:00` to `12:00:59`, then start a new window at `12:01:00`.

- **Count-Based Tumbling Window**:  
  - Based on a **fixed number of events**.
  - Example: A window of size 100 processes every 100 events, then starts a new window.

- **Characteristics**:
  - No overlap between windows.
  - Well-suited for periodic reports or time-fixed aggregation.

- **Example Use Case**:
  - Compute total sales every hour.

#### **2.2 Sliding Window**  
Fixed-size windows that overlap, with a configurable **slide interval**.

- **Temporal Sliding Window**:
  - Defined by a **time duration** and a **slide interval**.
  - Example: A 1-minute window sliding every 30 seconds will create overlapping windows:  
    - `[12:00:00 - 12:00:59]`, `[12:00:30 - 12:01:29]`, etc.

- **Count-Based Sliding Window**:
  - Defined by a **number of events** and a **slide size**.
  - Example: A window of size 10 with a slide size of 5 processes every 10 events with a 5-event overlap.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Allows event reuse across overlapping windows.
  - Ideal for **rolling averages** or **trend detection**.

- **Example Use Case**:
  - Calculate the moving average of stock prices every 30 seconds.

### **3. Comparisons Between Tumbling and Sliding Windows**

| **Aspect**           | **Tumbling Window**                       | **Sliding Window**                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Overlap**           | No overlap; non-overlapping chunks.       | Overlapping chunks; events can appear in multiple windows. |
| **Configuration**     | Single parameter: window size.            | Two parameters: window size and slide interval. |
| **Use Case**          | Periodic reporting, batch summaries.      | Rolling aggregates, trend detection.     |
| **Complexity**        | Lower computational overhead.             | Higher due to event reuse across windows.|

### **4. Example Implementations**

#### **Tumbling Window Example** (Temporal Tumbling)
```java
// Apache Flink
dataStream.keyBy(event -> event.getKey())
          .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(Time.minutes(5))) // 5-minute windows
          .sum("value")
          .print();
```

#### **Tumbling Window Example** (Count-Based Tumbling)
```java
// Apache Flink
dataStream.keyBy(event -> event.getKey())
          .countWindow(100) // 100-event windows
          .sum("value")
          .print();
```

#### **Sliding Window Example** (Temporal Sliding)
```java
// Apache Flink
dataStream.keyBy(event -> event.getKey())
          .window(SlidingEventTimeWindows.of(Time.minutes(5), Time.minutes(1))) // 5-minute window, 1-minute slide
          .sum("value")
          .print();
```

#### **Sliding Window Example** (Count-Based Sliding)
```java
// Apache Flink
dataStream.keyBy(event -> event.getKey())
          .countWindow(100, 20) // Window of 100 events, sliding by 20
          .sum("value")
          .print();
```

### **5. Choosing the Right Window and Policy**

| **Scenario**                     | **Recommended Window**       | **Trigger/Eviction Policy**            |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Periodic reporting               | Tumbling (Temporal)          | Time-based trigger, no eviction.       |
| Detecting trends or anomalies    | Sliding (Temporal)           | Time-based trigger, time-based eviction.|
| Real-time monitoring             | Sliding (Count-Based)        | Early trigger, count-based eviction.   |
| Managing fixed-size batches      | Tumbling (Count-Based)       | Count-based trigger, count-based eviction. |

### **7. Best Practices**

1. **Balance Window Size and Slide Interval**:  
   - Large windows capture more data but increase latency.  
   - Small slide intervals provide high granularity but higher computational costs.

2. **Use Early and Late Triggers**:  
   - Emit intermediate results for real-time insights.  
   - Handle late-arriving data to improve accuracy.

3. **Optimize Policies for Data Characteristics**:  
   - Time-based policies for continuous streams.  
   - Count-based policies for bursty streams.

4. **Test with Real Workloads**:  
   - Simulate various conditions to refine window sizes and triggers.
