### **Streaming Data: Reservoir Sampling**

**Reservoir Sampling** is a technique used for random sampling from a stream of unknown size. The key idea is that the algorithm allows you to maintain a fixed-size sample from an unbounded stream of incoming data, ensuring that every item in the stream has an equal probability of being included in the sample.

This method is particularly useful when the total size of the data is unknown in advance and cannot be stored in memory. It allows you to sample data without needing to keep track of every item in the stream.

### **Why Reservoir Sampling?**

- **Unbounded Streams**: When dealing with real-time data streams, like sensor data, user logs, or financial transactions, it is often impractical to store the entire stream in memory.
- **Fixed-size Sample**: The goal is to maintain a sample of fixed size $\( k \)$, even as new data points arrive.
- **Uniform Probability**: Every element of the stream should have an equal chance of being included in the sample, regardless of when it arrives.

### **Reservoir Sampling Algorithm**

Let’s assume we want to maintain a sample of size $\( k \)$ from a stream of unknown size.

1. **Initialization**: Start by filling the reservoir with the first $\( k \)$ items from the stream. These first $\( k \)$ items will automatically be part of the sample.

2. **Processing subsequent items**: For each subsequent item \( i \) (starting from the \( (k+1)^{th} \) item):
   - Generate a random number $\( j \)$ between 1 and $\( i \)$ (inclusive).
   - If $\( j \leq k \)$, replace the $\( j^{th} \)$ item in the reservoir with the current item.

3. **End of Stream**: After processing all items in the stream, the reservoir will contain the final random sample of size $\( k \)$.

### **Reservoir Sampling Pseudo Code**

```plaintext
Algorithm Reservoir-Sampling(S, k):
    1. Initialize an empty array or list reservoir[] of size k
    2. For i = 1 to k:
        a. Set reservoir[i] = S[i]  // First k elements fill the reservoir
    
    3. For i = k+1 to ∞ (next elements from the stream):
        a. Generate a random index j in the range [1, i]
        b. If j <= k:
            i. Replace reservoir[j-1] with S[i]  // Replace element in the reservoir

    4. Return the array reservoir[]
```

### **Detailed Steps for Reservoir Sampling**

#### **Step 1: Initialize the Reservoir**

- Start by placing the first $\( k \)$ elements from the stream into the reservoir.
  
#### **Step 2: Process Incoming Items**

- For each new item in the stream, generate a random number $\( j \)$ between 1 and the current item index $\( i \)$.
- If $\( j \)$ is less than or equal to $\( k \)$, replace the $\( j^{th} \)$ item in the reservoir with the new item.
  
This ensures that all items have an equal chance of being included in the sample.

#### **Step 3: Keep the Sample Size Fixed**

- When the stream reaches a size larger than $\( k \)$, the reservoir maintains the size of $\( k \)$ by replacing one of the items randomly for each new incoming item.

#### **Step 4: End of Stream**

- After the stream is processed, the reservoir contains a sample of $\( k \)$ items that is randomly selected from the entire stream.

### **Example of Reservoir Sampling**

Let’s go through a simple example:

- **Stream**: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
- **Sample Size (k)**: 3

#### **Step 1: Initialize Reservoir**
- Reservoir: [10, 20, 30] (first 3 elements)

#### **Step 2: Process Item 4 (40)**
- Random number generated: $\( j = 2 \)$
- Since $\( j = 2 \leq 3 \)$, replace the 2nd item (20) with 40.
- Updated Reservoir: [10, 40, 30]

#### **Step 3: Process Item 5 (50)**
- Random number generated: $\( j = 5 \)$
- Since $\( j > 3 \)$, do not replace any item.
- Reservoir remains: [10, 40, 30]

#### **Step 4: Process Item 6 (60)**
- Random number generated: $\( j = 1 \)$
- Since $\( j = 1 \leq 3 \)$, replace the 1st item (10) with 60.
- Updated Reservoir: [60, 40, 30]

#### **Step 5: Process Item 7 (70)**
- Random number generated: $\( j = 3 \)$
- Since $\( j = 3 \leq 3 \)$, replace the 3rd item (30) with 70.
- Final Reservoir: [60, 40, 70]

The final sample contains three items from the stream: **[60, 40, 70]**.

### **Code Example: Reservoir Sampling in Python**

```python
import random

def reservoir_sampling(stream, k):
    # Initialize the reservoir with the first k elements from the stream
    reservoir = []
    for i in range(k):
        reservoir.append(stream[i])
    
    # Process the remaining elements in the stream
    for i in range(k, len(stream)):
        # Generate a random index between 1 and i+1 (inclusive)
        j = random.randint(1, i+1)
        if j <= k:
            reservoir[j-1] = stream[i]  # Replace element in the reservoir
    
    return reservoir

# Example usage
stream = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
k = 3
sampled_data = reservoir_sampling(stream, k)
print(f"Sampled Data: {sampled_data}")
```

**Output**:
```plaintext
Sampled Data: [60, 40, 70]
```

This Python code demonstrates how reservoir sampling works by processing a stream and maintaining a fixed-size sample.

### **Applications of Reservoir Sampling**

1. **Real-Time Analytics**:
   - In applications like monitoring user interactions, sensor data, or website traffic, reservoir sampling allows the system to maintain a representative sample of events over time, even when the total number of events is large or unbounded.

2. **Distributed Systems**:
   - In distributed streaming systems (e.g., Kafka, Spark), where data is continuously flowing from various sources, reservoir sampling helps reduce the overhead of processing all incoming data.

3. **Sampling in Big Data**:
   - When dealing with massive datasets, especially when it's impossible to store or process the entire data at once, reservoir sampling allows for manageable and efficient sampling.

4. **Data Stream Learning**:
   - In machine learning tasks involving real-time data streams, reservoir sampling can be used to maintain a sample of incoming data for training models or for anomaly detection.

### **Complexity and Performance**

- **Time Complexity**: $\( O(1) \)$ for each item, as generating a random number and replacing an item in the reservoir both take constant time. Thus, processing $\( n \)$ items takes $\( O(n) \)$ time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: $\( O(k) \)$, as the algorithm only needs to store a fixed number $\( k \)$ of items in the reservoir.

---

### **Summary**

Reservoir sampling is an efficient and widely used technique for random sampling in streaming data scenarios where the total size of the data is not known in advance. By maintaining a fixed-size reservoir and replacing elements as new data arrives, it ensures that every item in the stream has an equal probability of being included in the sample, making it ideal for real-time analytics, monitoring, and machine learning applications.
