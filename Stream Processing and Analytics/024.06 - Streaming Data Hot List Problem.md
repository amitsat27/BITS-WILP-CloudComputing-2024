### **Streaming Data Hot List Problem**

The **Hot List Problem** in streaming data refers to the task of maintaining a **hot list** (or **top-k list**) of the most frequent or most recently seen items in a stream of data. The "hot list" typically consists of items that occur most frequently, or items that are accessed most often in a given window of time. This problem arises frequently in use cases like:

- **Trending topics** on social media platforms
- **Top-selling products** in e-commerce
- **Most popular items** in recommendation systems
- **Frequently occurring events** in network traffic

The key challenge is to efficiently maintain and update the hot list as new data arrives, given that the stream may be unbounded, and it's impractical to store and process every item in real-time.

---

### **Goal**
The goal of the hot list problem is to efficiently identify and maintain the **top-k most frequent or most recent items** in a streaming data environment. This involves processing incoming items in real-time and updating the list without having to keep track of all data points.

---

### **Key Considerations**
- **Memory constraints**: The hot list needs to be maintained in limited memory (often of size $\( k \))$.
- **Data volume**: The volume of data in streams can be huge and unbounded.
- **Efficient updates**: The algorithm should support efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of items in the hot list.

---

### **Solution Approach for Hot List Problem**

To maintain a **hot list** or **top-k list** in streaming data, we can use a **frequency-based approach** or **recency-based approach** depending on whether the goal is to track the most frequent or the most recent items.

#### **Frequency-based Approach**
- The idea is to maintain a count of the occurrences of each item and keep track of the top-k items that occur most frequently.

#### **Recency-based Approach**
- The goal is to maintain the most recently seen items. Here, we keep track of the last $\( k \)$ items that arrived.

### **Frequency-based Hot List Algorithm:**

#### **1. Count-Min Sketch (CMS)**

The **Count-Min Sketch** is a popular probabilistic data structure used to approximate frequency counts of items in a stream. It allows for efficient tracking of the top-k frequent items without needing to store every item.

**Count-Min Sketch** provides approximate counts with some level of error, but it significantly reduces memory usage compared to storing full frequency counts.

**Steps**:
1. Maintain a **Count-Min Sketch** table with multiple hash functions to estimate the frequency of items.
2. As each item arrives, update its count in the table.
3. Periodically check the counts of items in the table and select the top-k most frequent items.

#### **2. Misra-Gries Algorithm (for Approximate Top-k)**

The **Misra-Gries Algorithm** is another efficient method for finding the approximate top-k items in a stream. It is particularly useful when the frequency of items is not too large compared to the stream size.

**Steps**:
1. Maintain a list of \( k \) counters initialized to zero.
2. For each incoming item:
   - If the item is already in the list, increment its counter.
   - If the item is not in the list, and there is space for new items, add it with a counter initialized to 1.
   - If the list is full, decrement all counters by 1, and remove items whose counters reach zero.
3. At the end of the stream, the items in the list are the approximate top-k frequent items.

### **Recency-based Hot List Algorithm:**

#### **1. Sliding Window with Hash Map**

For maintaining a **recency-based hot list** (e.g., most recent $\( k \)$ items), a simple **sliding window** approach using a **hash map** can be used. In this approach:
1. Maintain a hash map that maps items to their timestamps.
2. As new items arrive, insert them into the map with the current timestamp.
3. For each incoming item, check if the window has expired, and remove the items that are outside the window.
4. The hash map will then contain the top \( k \) most recent items in the window.

### **Pseudo Code for Frequency-based Hot List (Misra-Gries)**

```plaintext
Algorithm Misra-Gries-Top-k(stream, k):
    1. Initialize a list `counters[]` of size k, with all counters set to 0
    2. Initialize a list `items[]` of size k, to store the current candidates

    3. For each item in the stream:
        a. If the item is already in `items[]`:
            i. Increment its counter in `counters[]`
        b. Else if there is space in `items[]`:
            i. Add the item to `items[]` with counter 1
        c. Else:
            i. Decrease all counters in `counters[]` by 1
            ii. Remove items with counter 0

    4. After processing the stream, the items in `items[]` are the approximate top-k items

    5. Return `items[]` as the top-k list
```

### **Example of Misra-Gries Algorithm**

Consider a stream of events: `["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "apple"]` and we want to find the top 2 most frequent items.

1. Initialize:
   - `items[] = []`
   - `counters[] = []`
2. Process "apple":
   - Since it's not in `items[]`, add it: `items[] = ["apple"]`, `counters[] = [1]`
3. Process "banana":
   - Add it: `items[] = ["apple", "banana"]`, `counters[] = [1, 1]`
4. Process "apple":
   - Increment counter for "apple": `items[] = ["apple", "banana"]`, `counters[] = [2, 1]`
5. Process "orange":
   - Add it: `items[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]`, `counters[] = [2, 1, 1]`
6. Process "apple":
   - Increment counter for "apple": `items[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]`, `counters[] = [3, 1, 1]`
7. Process "banana":
   - Increment counter for "banana": `items[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]`, `counters[] = [3, 2, 1]`
8. Process "apple":
   - Increment counter for "apple": `items[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]`, `counters[] = [4, 2, 1]`

At the end, the approximate top-2 frequent items are: `["apple", "banana"]`.

---

In the case where \( k = 2 \), the **Misra-Gries Algorithm** will maintain only the **top-2 most frequent items** from the stream. Letâ€™s go through the steps again using the same stream of events and \( k = 2 \).

### Stream of events: 
`["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "apple"]`

### Algorithm Walkthrough for \( k = 2 \):

#### 1. Initialize
- `items[] = []`  (empty list to store items)
- `counters[] = []`  (empty list for counters)

#### 2. Process events

- **Process "apple"**:
  - "apple" is not in `items[]`, so add it:  
    `items[] = ["apple"]`, `counters[] = [1]`
  
- **Process "banana"**:
  - "banana" is not in `items[]`, so add it:  
    `items[] = ["apple", "banana"]`, `counters[] = [1, 1]`

- **Process "apple"**:
  - "apple" is already in `items[]`, so increment its counter:  
    `items[] = ["apple", "banana"]`, `counters[] = [2, 1]`

- **Process "orange"**:
  - "orange" is not in `items[]`, but we have space for new items (since \( k = 2 \)), so we add it:  
    `items[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]`, `counters[] = [2, 1, 1]`
  - However, since the list size exceeds \( k = 2 \), we need to apply the Misra-Gries rule:
    - Decrease all counters by 1:  
      `counters[] = [1, 0, 0]`
    - Remove the items whose counters reach zero:  
      `items[] = ["apple"]`, `counters[] = [1]`
  
- **Process "apple"**:
  - "apple" is already in `items[]`, so increment its counter:  
    `items[] = ["apple"]`, `counters[] = [2]`

- **Process "banana"**:
  - "banana" is not in `items[]`, but the list has space for 1 more item. Add "banana":  
    `items[] = ["apple", "banana"]`, `counters[] = [2, 1]`

- **Process "apple"**:
  - "apple" is already in `items[]`, so increment its counter:  
    `items[] = ["apple", "banana"]`, `counters[] = [3, 1]`

- **Process "orange"**:
  - "orange" is not in `items[]`, so add it:  
    `items[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]`, `counters[] = [3, 1, 1]`
  - Again, the list exceeds \( k = 2 \), so we apply the Misra-Gries rule:
    - Decrease all counters by 1:  
      `counters[] = [2, 0, 0]`
    - Remove items with counter zero:  
      `items[] = ["apple"]`, `counters[] = [2]`

- **Process "apple"**:
  - "apple" is already in `items[]`, so increment its counter:  
    `items[] = ["apple"]`, `counters[] = [3]`

#### 3. Final top-k items
- After processing all events, the final `items[]` and `counters[]` are:
  - `items[] = ["apple"]`
  - `counters[] = [5]`

Thus, **"apple"** is the only item remaining in the list, and it is the most frequent item in the stream.

---

### Key Takeaways
- When $\( k = 2 \)$, the algorithm tries to maintain the top 2 most frequent items.
- However, if the frequency counts exceed $\( k \)$, the Misra-Gries algorithm evicts items from the list when their counters drop to zero after decrements. 
- In the example, even though "banana" and "orange" appeared in the stream, their counts did not remain high enough to be included in the final list of top-2 items.

So, in this case, **only "apple"** remains in the hot list as it was the most frequent item.

### **Pseudo Code for Recency-based Hot List (Sliding Window)**

```plaintext
Algorithm Sliding-Window-Hot-List(stream, window_size, k):
    1. Initialize a hash map `items_map[]` to store items and their timestamps
    2. For each item in the stream:
        a. Add/update item in `items_map[]` with the current timestamp
        b. If the timestamp is outside the window (older than `window_size`):
            i. Remove that item from `items_map[]`
    3. Maintain a sorted list of the top-k items based on recency
    4. Return the top-k items
```

### **Example of Sliding Window Hot List**

Consider a stream of items arriving with timestamps and a sliding window of size 3:

1. Stream: `[("apple", 1), ("banana", 2), ("apple", 3), ("orange", 4), ("apple", 5)]`
2. Window size: 3 (items that arrived in the last 3 timestamps)

We maintain a sliding window and process the items.

- At time 1: `["apple"]`
- At time 2: `["apple", "banana"]`
- At time 3: `["apple", "banana"]`
- At time 4: `["banana", "apple", "orange"]` (window slides to remove "apple" at time 1)
- At time 5: `["apple", "banana", "orange"]` (window slides to remove "banana" at time 2)

Final top-3 items: `["apple", "banana", "orange"]`.

### **Use Cases of Hot List Algorithms**

1. **Trending Topics in Social Media**:
   - Track the most frequently mentioned hashtags, words, or topics in real time.
  
2. **Recommendation Systems**:
   - Keep a hot list of the top-selling products or most viewed content to recommend to users.
  
3. **Fraud Detection**:
   - Identify the top-k most suspicious accounts or transactions based on frequency of activity.

4. **Network Traffic Monitoring**:
   - Track the most frequent packets or connections that have been observed in real-time data streams.
