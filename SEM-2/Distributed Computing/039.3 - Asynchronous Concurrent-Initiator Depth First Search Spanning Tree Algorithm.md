This algorithm, referred to as **Algorithm III**, constructs a spanning tree in an asynchronous distributed system, using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to traverse the graph. It assumes that any node can initiate the algorithm spontaneously, similar to **Algorithm II**, and it handles concurrent initiations of the algorithm by different nodes. The key difference is that this algorithm explores the graph using DFS instead of flooding.

### Key Characteristics:
- **DFS-based Approach**: The algorithm uses a DFS traversal to identify the spanning tree. A node sends a `QUERY` to its neighbors one by one, waiting for an `ACCEPT` or `REJECT` message before proceeding to the next neighbor.
- **Handling Concurrent Initiations**: Like Algorithm II, multiple initiations can occur concurrently. When a node receives multiple `QUERY` messages from different roots, it chooses the root with the higher priority (`newroot` > `myroot`) and joins that spanning tree.

### Algorithm Overview:
Each process (node) maintains the following local variables:
- `parent`: The node that sent the first `QUERY` message and is considered the parent in the spanning tree.
- `myroot`: The identifier of the root node for the current spanning tree.
- `Children`: The set of nodes that have accepted the node as their parent.
- `Unknown`: The set of neighbors of the node that have not yet been queried.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. **Node Initiation**:
   - When a node wants to initiate the algorithm as a root (step 1), it sends a `QUERY` message to itself (step 1b) to start the process.

2. **Receiving a `QUERY(newroot)`**:
   - **If `newroot` > `myroot`** (step 2a): The node joins the subtree of the higher-priority root (`newroot`), updates its `parent` to the node that sent the `QUERY`, and sets `myroot` to `newroot`. It then proceeds with DFS by selecting a neighbor from `Unknown` and sending a `QUERY(myroot)` to that neighbor (steps 2d-2f). If there are no unknown neighbors left, it sends an `ACCEPT` message to the sender (step 2g).
   - **If `newroot` = `myroot`** (step 2h): The node is already part of the same tree, so it sends a `REJECT` message to the sender. 
   - **If `newroot` < `myroot`**: The node ignores the `QUERY` because it belongs to a subtree with a higher root, and the sender will eventually update its root when it receives a `QUERY(myroot)` from this node.

3. **Receiving an `ACCEPT(newroot)` or `REJECT(newroot)`**:
   - **If `newroot` = `myroot`** (step 3a):
     - **If it's an `ACCEPT` message** (step 3b): The sender of the `ACCEPT` message is added to the `Children` set (step 3c). If there are no more unknown neighbors (step 3d), the node either sends an `ACCEPT` message to its `parent` or, if it's the root of the spanning tree, it terminates (steps 3e-3g).
     - **If it's a `REJECT` message** (step 3h): The node selects the next unknown neighbor and sends a `QUERY(myroot)` to that neighbor (steps 3i-3j).
   - **If `newroot` < `myroot`**: The message is ignored because the node has already joined a subtree with a higher priority root.

### Concurrent Initiations:
Similar to Algorithm II, multiple nodes can initiate the algorithm concurrently. However, this DFS-based algorithm uses a tie-breaking rule where only the subtree initiated by the higher-priority root (the node with the larger identifier) is allowed to continue, while others are suppressed. This ensures that the resulting structure is a **single spanning tree** without cycles.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(l)` messages, where `l` is the number of edges in the graph.
- **Message Complexity**: The number of messages is `O(nl)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.

### Termination:
The termination of this algorithm is similar to that of Algorithm II. Only the root node knows when the algorithm has terminated, and it can inform the other nodes by sending a special message along the tree edges.

### Example Execution:
If nodes **A**, **G**, and **J** initiate the algorithm concurrently:
- **A** starts querying its neighbors using DFS.
- **G** and **J** do the same.
- If a node receives queries from multiple initiators, it compares the roots and joins the tree with the higher priority root.
- DFS ensures that once a node starts participating in one spanning tree, it will not join another one.

In case of conflicts, where two trees initiated by different roots meet, the tree with the lower-priority root is suppressed, ensuring that only one spanning tree is constructed.
