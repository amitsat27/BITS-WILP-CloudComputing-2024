### **Terminating Reliable Broadcast**

**Terminating Reliable Broadcast** (TRB) is a communication primitive in distributed systems that ensures all non-faulty processes receive the same message from a source process, even in the presence of failures. TRB is particularly useful in systems requiring consistent message delivery under unreliable or adversarial conditions.

---

### **Key Properties**

A **Terminating Reliable Broadcast** must satisfy the following properties:

1. **Validity**:
   - If the source process is correct and broadcasts a message \( m \), then all correct processes eventually receive \( m \).

2. **Agreement**:
   - If a correct process receives \( m \), then all other correct processes also receive \( m \).

3. **Integrity**:
   - A correct process receives a message \( m \) only if \( m \) was broadcast by the source.

4. **Termination**:
   - Every correct process eventually decides on a message (either the one broadcast or an indication of failure).

---

### **Algorithm Design**

The implementation of a TRB algorithm depends on the type of failures the system can encounter. The two most common fault models are **crash failures** and **Byzantine failures**.

---

#### **1. TRB in the Crash-Failure Model**

##### **Assumptions**:
- The source process can crash.
- Reliable communication ensures that messages sent between correct processes are always delivered.

##### **Algorithm**:

1. **Broadcast Phase**:
   - The source broadcasts the message \( m \) to all processes.

2. **Relay Phase**:
   - Upon receiving \( m \) from the source, a process relays \( m \) to all other processes.
   - This ensures that even if the source crashes, other processes can propagate \( m \).

3. **Decision Phase**:
   - A process decides on \( m \) once it has received \( m \) from either the source or another process.

---

#### **2. TRB in the Byzantine-Failure Model**

##### **Assumptions**:
- The source process or other processes may behave arbitrarily (send conflicting messages or no messages at all).
- At most \( f \) processes can be Byzantine, where \( n \geq 3f + 1 \).

##### **Algorithm (Modified Reliable Broadcast)**:

1. **Broadcast Phase**:
   - The source process broadcasts \( m \) to all processes.

2. **Relay Phase**:
   - When a process receives \( m \) for the first time, it relays \( m \) to all other processes.
   - A process accepts \( m \) only if it receives the same value \( m \) from at least \( f + 1 \) processes.

3. **Decision Phase**:
   - After receiving \( m \) from \( 2f + 1 \) processes, the process decides on \( m \).

---

### **Performance Metrics**

1. **Message Complexity**:
   - In the worst case, TRB requires \( O(n^2) \) messages due to relaying.

2. **Time Complexity**:
   - \( O(f + 1) \) rounds are needed for consensus in the Byzantine model.

3. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - TRB tolerates \( f \) faults under the constraint \( n \geq 3f + 1 \).

---

### **Example**

#### Scenario:
- \( n = 7 \), \( f = 2 \) Byzantine processes (\( P_3, P_5 \)).
- Source process (\( P_1 \)) broadcasts \( m = "Hello" \).

1. **Broadcast Phase**:
   - \( P_1 \) sends \( m = "Hello" \) to all processes.

2. **Relay Phase**:
   - Non-faulty processes (\( P_2, P_4, P_6, P_7 \)) relay \( "Hello" \) to others.
   - Byzantine processes (\( P_3, P_5 \)) may send conflicting messages.

3. **Decision Phase**:
   - Non-faulty processes accept \( "Hello" \) only after receiving it from \( f + 1 = 3 \) processes.
   - Decision: All correct processes decide on \( m = "Hello" \).

---

### **Conclusion**

Terminating Reliable Broadcast ensures robust and consistent message delivery in distributed systems with crash or Byzantine failures. By incorporating relaying and majority-based decision-making, TRB provides fault tolerance and guarantees agreement and termination among correct processes. It is foundational for achieving higher-level consensus primitives like **Byzantine Agreement** and **Atomic Broadcast**.
