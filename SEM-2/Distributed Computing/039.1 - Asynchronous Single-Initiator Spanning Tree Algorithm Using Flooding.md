### Asynchronous Single-Initiator Spanning Tree Algorithm Using Flooding: Algorithm I

This algorithm constructs a spanning tree from a designated root node using an asynchronous flooding technique. The root node initiates the construction by sending out **QUERY** messages to its neighbors, and each node decides whether to join the tree based on the first QUERY it receives.

#### Key Concepts:
- **QUERY Message**: A message sent to neighbors to explore the spanning tree.
- **ACCEPT Message**: Sent by a node in response to the first QUERY it receives, acknowledging that it will join the spanning tree.
- **REJECT Message**: Sent by a node in response to any subsequent QUERYs it receives after accepting the first one.

### Algorithm Details

#### Local Variables:
- `parent`: Initially set to `?`. This will store the identifier of the node's parent in the spanning tree.
- `Children`: A set of the node's children in the spanning tree.
- `Unrelated`: A set of nodes from which the node received REJECT messages (indicating they are not part of the node's subtree).
- `Neighbors`: The set of all neighbors for the current node.

#### Messages Types:
- `QUERY`
- `ACCEPT`
- `REJECT`

#### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Initiation by the Root**:
   - The root node starts by sending **QUERY** messages to all its neighbors.
   - It sets its own `parent` to itself (i.e., the root).

2. **Receiving a QUERY**:
   - When a node `P_i` receives a QUERY from neighbor `P_j`, it checks if it has already assigned a parent.
     - If `parent = ?`, it sets `P_j` as its parent, sends an **ACCEPT** message to `P_j`, and forwards **QUERY** messages to all its other neighbors (excluding `P_j`).
     - If the node already has a parent, it sends a **REJECT** message to `P_j`.

3. **Receiving an ACCEPT**:
   - If a node receives an **ACCEPT** from one of its neighbors, it adds that neighbor to its `Children` set.

4. **Receiving a REJECT**:
   - If a node receives a **REJECT**, it adds the sender to its `Unrelated` set.

5. **Termination**:
   - A node terminates when it has received responses (either **ACCEPT** or **REJECT**) from all its non-parent neighbors. This means the node knows whether all of its neighbors are either part of its subtree (children) or unrelated (non-children).

### Example Execution:

Consider a graph of nodes A, B, C, D, E, and F, where A is the initiator:

```
   A
  / \
 B   F
/ \ / \
C  D   E
```

1. **Step 1: Initiation**:
   - A sends a **QUERY** to B and F.

2. **Step 2: Forwarding**:
   - F receives the QUERY from A and sets A as its parent. It sends **QUERY** to E and C.
   - B receives the QUERY from A and sets A as its parent. It sends **QUERY** to C and D.

3. **Step 3: Further Propagation**:
   - E receives the QUERY from F and sets F as its parent. It forwards the QUERY to B and D.
   - C and D receive QUERYs from multiple neighbors and decide their parent based on the first one they receive. For instance, C receives QUERYs from both F and B, so it will choose one and reject the other.

4. **Step 4: Accept and Reject**:
   - Once the nodes determine their parent, they send **ACCEPT** messages to the parent from whom they received the first QUERY and **REJECT** messages to the others. For example:
     - C accepts B and rejects F.
     - D accepts B and rejects E.

5. **Step 5: Termination**:
   - Once each node receives **ACCEPT** or **REJECT** from all neighbors, it terminates. The root node terminates last after receiving acknowledgments from all its neighbors.

### Complexity

- **Local Space Complexity**: The local space at each node is proportional to the number of neighbors (degree of the node). Each node must store its parent, children, and unrelated neighbors.
  
- **Message Complexity**:
  - Each edge is involved in sending at least two messages (a QUERY and its response, either ACCEPT or REJECT).
  - At most, four messages are sent per edge when two QUERYs are sent concurrently.
  - Thus, the message complexity is between `2l` and `4l` where `l` is the number of edges.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - In an asynchronous system, there is no global time bound, and message propagation depends on network delays.
  - The depth of the resulting tree may correspond to the longest path from the root to any other node (bounded by `n-1` in a depth-first traversal).

---

### Example:

In the example execution:

1. **A** sends QUERY to **B** and **F**.
2. **F** accepts A and forwards QUERY to **E** and **C**.
3. **B** accepts A and forwards QUERY to **C** and **D**.
4. **C** accepts **B** and rejects **F**.
5. **D** accepts **B** and rejects **E**.
6. Each node sends ACCEPT or REJECT messages as appropriate, and once responses from all neighbors are received, the nodes terminate.

---

### Observations:

- **No guarantee of a BFS Tree**: This algorithm does not guarantee a breadth-first tree because nodes respond asynchronously and in no particular order. For example, if a node receives QUERY messages from different parents at different times, it picks the first one, which may not result in the shortest path to the root.
  
- **Possible modifications**: A modified version of this algorithm could enforce a breadth-first search (BFS) tree by adding conditions to ensure that the shortest path to the root is followed when selecting parents.

---

This algorithm works efficiently in asynchronous systems, where there are no guarantees on message delivery times, and the termination condition is handled locally by each node.
