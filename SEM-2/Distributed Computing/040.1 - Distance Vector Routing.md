The **Distance Vector Routing (DVR)** algorithm is a dynamic routing protocol that allows nodes in a network to discover the shortest paths to all other nodes, adapting to changes in network topology and link costs. Below is a detailed explanation of the DVR algorithm, including its features, modifications from the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and its operation in dynamic environments.

### Overview of Distance Vector Routing (DVR)

#### Key Modifications from Bellman-Ford Algorithm
1. **Indefinite Loop**:
   - The outer loop in DVR runs indefinitely to accommodate continuous changes in the network, as link weights (delays or loads) may change dynamically.

2. **Distance Vector Representation**:
   - The single `length` variable is replaced by an array `LENGTH[1..n]`, where:
     - `LENGTH[k]` represents the shortest path length from the current node to node \( k \).
   - Each `UPDATE` message now contains the entire `LENGTH` vector of the sending node, allowing nodes to receive and compare the distance vectors from their neighbors.

3. **Routing Table**:
   - The single `parent` variable is replaced with an array `PARENT[1..n]`, where:
     - `PARENT[k]` indicates the next hop node to reach node \( k \).
   - This serves as the routing table for the node.

4. **Periodic Updates**:
   - Nodes exchange their distance vectors periodically, adapting to changes in the network. If a message is not received within the expected period, a default value is assumed for the link, allowing the algorithm to proceed.

5. **Triangle Inequality**:
   - The triangle inequality from the Bellman-Ford algorithm is applied during each round to update the `LENGTH` vectors based on the received distance vectors.

#### Algorithm Steps
Here's a high-level pseudocode representation of the Distance Vector Routing algorithm:

```plaintext
(local variables)
array LENGTH[1..n];       // Shortest path lengths to all nodes
array PARENT[1..n];       // Routing table for next hops
set of int Neighbors;      // Neighbor nodes

(1) Initialization:
    for each node k in Neighbors do
        LENGTH[k] = weight to k;   // Initial distances to neighbors
        PARENT[k] = k;              // Next hop is itself

(2) // Infinite loop for distance vector updates
while true do:
    (3) for each neighbor m in Neighbors do
        send UPDATE(LENGTH) to m;  // Send distance vector to neighbors

    (4) await UPDATE(LENGTH_m) from each m in Neighbors;

    (5) // Update distance vector using received LENGTH vectors
    for each destination node k do:
        for each neighbor m do:
            if LENGTH[k] > LENGTH_m[k] + weight(m, current_node) then
                LENGTH[k] = LENGTH_m[k] + weight(m, current_node);
                PARENT[k] = m;   // Update next hop for node k

    (6) // Optional: Monitor for link failures or updates
    for each neighbor m do
        if no message received from m within period then
            assume default value for LENGTH[m];
```

### Features of Distance Vector Routing
1. **Dynamic Adaptation**: 
   - The algorithm continuously adjusts the routing paths based on changing network conditions, allowing for efficient routing even as link costs fluctuate.

2. **Asynchronous Operation**:
   - DVR operates in an essentially asynchronous manner, but if the period between updates is significantly longer than message propagation and processing times, it can behave synchronously.

3. **Scalability**:
   - DVR is suitable for both small and large networks, as each node only needs to maintain information about its neighbors and the shortest paths to all nodes.

4. **Simplicity**:
   - The design of DVR is straightforward, making it easier to implement compared to other more complex routing protocols.

### Termination and Convergence
- **Convergence**: DVR does not have a formal termination condition like the synchronous Bellman-Ford algorithm due to the ongoing changes in the network. However, it converges when all nodes have consistent routing information across the network.
- **Link Failures**: DVR can handle link failures by detecting when a neighbor fails to send updates within the expected time frame, allowing nodes to assume default values for those links.

### Conclusion
The Distance Vector Routing algorithm is an effective solution for routing in dynamic networks, allowing nodes to continuously adapt to changes in link weights and network topology. By utilizing distance vectors and periodic updates, DVR ensures that all nodes maintain accurate and efficient routing information, facilitating effective communication across the network.
