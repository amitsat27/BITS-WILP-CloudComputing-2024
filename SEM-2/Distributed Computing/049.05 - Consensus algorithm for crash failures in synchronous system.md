### **Consensus Algorithm for Crash Failures in Synchronous Systems**

In a synchronous system, where communication and processing have known time bounds, achieving consensus in the presence of **crash failures** is relatively easier compared to handling Byzantine faults. The goal is for all **non-faulty processes** to agree on a single value despite some processes potentially failing by **stopping execution**.

---

### **Assumptions in a Crash-Failure Model**

1. **Synchronous Environment**:
   - Communication delays and processing times are bounded.
   - Messages sent from one process to another will be delivered within a known time.

2. **Crash Failures**:
   - A process can stop executing (crash) at any point.
   - Once crashed, a process does not resume execution or send further messages.

3. **Correct Processes**:
   - At least \( n - f \) processes are correct, where \( f \) is the maximum number of crash failures that the system can tolerate.

4. **Communication Reliability**:
   - Messages sent between correct processes are always delivered.

5. **Unique Identifiers**:
   - Each process has a unique ID for identification and coordination.

### **Algorithm Overview: Round-Based Majority Voting**

A simple consensus algorithm for crash failures in synchronous systems is based on **rounds of communication** and **majority voting**.

---

#### **Steps of the Algorithm**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Each process starts with a proposed value \( v_i \).

2. **Round Communication**:
   - In each round, every process broadcasts its current value to all other processes.

3. **Value Update**:
   - After receiving values from other processes:
     - A process updates its value to the **majority value** among the received messages, including its own.
     - If there is a tie, it may default to a predefined value (e.g., the smallest value).

4. **Decision**:
   - The algorithm runs for \( f + 1 \) rounds to ensure all processes agree.
   - At the end of the final round, each process decides on its current value.

5. **Termination**:
   - All processes terminate after \( f + 1 \) rounds.

---

### **Why \( f + 1 \) Rounds?**

- In the worst case, all \( f \) faulty processes may crash without sending any values.
- The \( f + 1 \) rounds ensure that the remaining correct processes can still exchange their values and converge to a consistent decision.

---

### **Properties of the Algorithm**

1. **Agreement**:
   - All correct processes decide on the same value after \( f + 1 \) rounds.

2. **Validity**:
   - If all correct processes propose the same initial value, that value is chosen.

3. **Termination**:
   - The algorithm terminates after \( f + 1 \) rounds.

4. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - The algorithm can tolerate up to \( f \) crash failures, where \( f \) satisfies \( n > f + 1 \).

---

### **Example**

#### Scenario:
- **Processes**: \( P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5 \).
- **Maximum Crash Faults**: \( f = 2 \).
- **Initial Proposals**:
  - \( P_1: 1 \), \( P_2: 1 \), \( P_3: 0 \), \( P_4: 1 \), \( P_5: 0 \).

---

#### Round 1:
- Each process broadcasts its value.
- **Messages Received**:
  - \( P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5 \) receive: \( \{1, 1, 0, 1, 0\} \).
- Majority value: \( 1 \).
- Each process updates its value to \( 1 \).

---

#### Round 2:
- Assume \( P_3 \) and \( P_5 \) crash and send no messages.
- **Messages Received**:
  - Remaining processes receive values: \( \{1, 1, 1\} \).
- Majority value: \( 1 \).
- Processes maintain \( 1 \) as the value.

---

#### Decision:
- After \( f + 1 = 3 \) rounds, all correct processes agree on \( 1 \) and terminate.

---

### **Optimizations**

1. **Message Reduction**:
   - Use a coordinator to reduce message exchanges by collecting and disseminating values.

2. **Failure Detection**:
   - Integrate failure detection mechanisms to handle non-responding processes proactively.

---

### **Conclusion**

Consensus for crash failures in synchronous systems relies on predictable communication and bounded execution times. Using simple **majority voting** with \( f + 1 \) rounds ensures that all correct processes converge to a consistent decision despite up to \( f \) crashes. This approach is efficient and well-suited for systems with bounded delays and reliable communication.
