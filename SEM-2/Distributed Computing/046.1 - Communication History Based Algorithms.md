### Communication History Based Algorithms

Algorithms in this class ensure ordering requirements by leveraging a portion of the communication history. These algorithms focus on tracking messages in relation to their send and receive times to enforce specific ordering guarantees. Notable algorithms in this category include:

#### 1. **RST (Raynal, Schiper, Toueg) Algorithm**
   - **Ordering Guarantee**: Causal ordering.
   - **Group Configuration**: Works for open-group multicasts.
   - **Mechanism**: The RST algorithm ensures that messages are delivered in the order that respects causal relationships. This means that if one message causally precedes another, all processes must deliver the first message before the second one. It doesn't need to explicitly track group memberships, making it efficient for systems where membership changes frequently.

#### 2. **KS (Kumar, Singh) Algorithm**
   - **Ordering Guarantee**: Causal ordering.
   - **Group Configuration**: Like RST, the KS algorithm also works for open-group multicasts and does not track separate groups.
   - **Mechanism**: This algorithm ensures causal ordering by maintaining a history of the causal relationships between messages. It ensures that all processes receive and deliver messages in an order that respects these relationships.

#### 3. **Lamport's Scalar Timestamp Algorithm**
   - **Ordering Guarantee**: Total ordering.
   - **Group Configuration**: Closed-group configuration.
   - **Mechanism**: Each message is assigned a **scalar timestamp** when sent, which indicates the logical time of the message. A process can only deliver a message once it has confirmed that no other message with a lower timestamp will be received. This ensures total ordering of messages across the system. 
   - **Limitation**: While it guarantees total order, it does **not guarantee causal order**, meaning that a message could be delivered before another message that causally preceded it.

#### 4. **NewTop Protocol**
   - **Ordering Guarantee**: Total and causal ordering.
   - **Group Configuration**: Closed-group configuration.
   - **Mechanism**: An extension of Lamport’s scalar timestamp algorithm, the NewTop protocol is designed to handle overlapping groups. It enhances the basic algorithm by providing both total and causal ordering, which ensures that causality is preserved while also delivering messages in the same total order across all processes. 
   - **Application**: Useful in systems where both strong consistency (total order) and causality (causal order) must be maintained across multiple overlapping groups.

### Summary:
- **RST and KS Algorithms** provide causal ordering without needing to track group memberships, making them well-suited for open-group multicast scenarios.
- **Lamport’s Scalar Timestamp Algorithm** guarantees total order but not causal order, and it is designed for closed groups.
- **NewTop Protocol** extends Lamport's algorithm to guarantee both total and causal ordering in closed groups with overlapping members.

These communication history-based algorithms are foundational for maintaining consistency and ordering in distributed systems, particularly in environments where message ordering (whether total, causal, or both) is critical.
