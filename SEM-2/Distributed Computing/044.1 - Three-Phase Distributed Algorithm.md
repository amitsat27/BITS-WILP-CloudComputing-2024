### Three-Phase Distributed Algorithm for Total and Causal Order

This algorithm is designed to ensure **total order** and **causal order** in **closed groups**. It operates through three phases, both for the sender and the receivers, and is typically used in group communication systems where processes collaborate and exchange messages in a distributed manner. Below, the phases are explained from both the sender's and the receiver's perspectives.

---

#### **Sender's Perspective**:

**Phase 1: Multicast the Message**  
1. **Action**: The sender process multicasts the message \( M \) to all group members.
   - Each message is tagged with a **locally unique tag** and a **local timestamp**.
   - The multicast is initiated by the sender (line 1b).

**Phase 2: Await and Compute the Final Timestamp**  
2. **Action**: The sender waits for replies from all group members.
   - Each group member responds with a **tentative proposal** for a new timestamp.
   - The **await** operation (line 1d) is **nonblocking**, meaning the sender can continue processing other messages in the meantime.
   - Once all replies are received, the sender computes the **maximum of the proposed timestamps** for the message \( M \). This computed maximum becomes the **final timestamp**.

**Phase 3: Multicast the Final Timestamp**  
3. **Action**: The sender multicasts the **final timestamp** to all group members (line 1f).
   - This final timestamp will be used by the receivers to order the messages.

#### **Receiver's Perspective**:

**Phase 1: Receive the Message and Proposed Timestamp**  
1. **Action**: The receiver receives the message along with the **tentative (proposed) timestamp**.
   - The receiver updates a variable called **priority**, which tracks the highest proposed timestamp (line 2a).
   - The receiver then revises the proposed timestamp to the updated **priority** and places the message (along with its tag and the revised timestamp) in a temporary queue called `temp_Q` (line 2b).
   - This entry in `temp_Q` is marked as **undeliverable** until the final timestamp is received.

**Phase 2: Send Back the Revised Timestamp**  
2. **Action**: The receiver sends the **revised timestamp** (and the message tag) back to the sender (line 2c).
   - While waiting for the final timestamp from the sender, the receiver continues to process other messages in a **nonblocking manner**.

**Phase 3: Receive the Final Timestamp and Deliver the Message**  
3. **Action**: The receiver receives the **final timestamp** from the sender (line 3).
   - The receiver uses the **message tag** to locate the corresponding message entry in `temp_Q` (line 3a).
   - The final timestamp overwrites the revised timestamp in `temp_Q` (line 3c), and the message is now marked as **deliverable**.
   - The queue `temp_Q` is then **resorted** using the updated timestamps as the sorting key (line 3c).
     - Since the queue is already sorted except for the entry being modified, only this entry needs to be repositioned within the queue.
   - If the modified message entry is at the head of `temp_Q` (i.e., the first entry), the receiver proceeds to **dequeue** it and move it to a second queue, `deliver_Q`, which holds messages ready for delivery (lines 3d-3g).
     - This process continues for any subsequent entries in `temp_Q` that are marked as deliverable, ensuring that all messages are delivered in the correct order.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Total and Causal Order**: This algorithm ensures both **total** and **causal order** by relying on a three-phase mechanism involving timestamps. The final timestamp ensures that messages are delivered in the same order across all group members.
- **Nonblocking Operations**: The nonblocking nature of both the sender and the receiver allows them to continue processing other messages even while waiting for replies or timestamps, improving system efficiency.
- **Efficient Queue Management**: Messages are stored in a temporary queue (`temp_Q`), sorted by their timestamps, and moved to a deliverable queue (`deliver_Q`) when ready. This ensures that messages are delivered in a consistent and ordered manner.

### Example Scenario:
- Two processes, \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \), issue updates to replicas \( R_1, R_2, R_3 \) in a distributed system.
- The messages sent by these processes must be delivered in a consistent order to avoid conflicts and ensure coherence among the replicas.
- By following this three-phase algorithm, all replicas will see the updates in the same order, preserving both total and causal consistency across the system. 

This algorithm is particularly useful in scenarios like **distributed databases** and **group communication systems** where maintaining message order is critical for system consistency.
