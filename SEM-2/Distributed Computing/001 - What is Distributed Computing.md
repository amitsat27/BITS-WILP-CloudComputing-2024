Distributed computing is a model in which multiple computers, often referred to as **nodes** or **machines**, work together to solve a problem or perform tasks. These computers are usually spread across different locations and communicate over a network. The key idea is to **divide** the task into smaller pieces, allowing each computer to handle part of the workload simultaneously.

### Key Concepts in Distributed Computing:
1. **Nodes**: Individual computers or systems participating in the network.
2. **Concurrency**: Multiple nodes perform tasks at the same time.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: If one node fails, others can continue working, ensuring the system as a whole remains operational.
4. **Scalability**: As the workload increases, more nodes can be added to handle the growing tasks efficiently.
5. **Communication**: Nodes must exchange information via messages to coordinate tasks, using protocols like TCP/IP.

### Common Uses:
- **Cloud Computing**: Platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure provide distributed computing resources.
- **Big Data**: Systems like Apache Hadoop and Spark process massive datasets using distributed computing.
- **Blockchain**: Distributed ledgers (like Bitcoin) operate on decentralized networks of nodes, making transactions more secure and resilient.

### Example:
Imagine a large puzzle. Instead of one person solving it alone, you distribute the pieces among a group of friends. Each person works on a section of the puzzle, and in the end, they combine their sections to complete it faster. This is how distributed computing works: splitting a task into smaller tasks that can be solved in parallel.
