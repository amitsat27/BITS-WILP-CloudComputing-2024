### **Lamport's Distributed Mutual Exclusion Algorithm**

**Lamport's Algorithm** is a **non-token-based** mutual exclusion algorithm used in distributed systems. It ensures mutual exclusion by relying on logical timestamps and message passing.

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Logical Clock**:
   - Each process maintains a **Lamport timestamp**, which is incremented for each event.
   - Timestamps help in ordering events across distributed processes.

2. **Message Passing**:
   - Processes communicate via three types of messages:
     - **Request**: Sent to request access to the critical section.
     - **Reply**: Sent in response to a request message.
     - **Release**: Sent to notify that the critical section has been exited.

---

### **Algorithm Steps**

#### **1. Requesting the Critical Section**
- A process $$\( P_i \)$$:
   1. Increments its logical clock $$(\( T_i \))$$.
   2. Sends a **Request(T_i, P_i)** message to all other processes.
   3. Adds its request to a local request queue, ordered by timestamp.

#### **2. Responding to Requests**
- When a process $$\( P_j \)$$ receives a **Request(T_i, P_i)** message:
   1. Updates its logical clock $$(\( T_j = \max(T_j, T_i) + 1 \))$$.
   2. Sends a **Reply** message to $$\( P_i \)$$.
   3. Adds the request to its local queue, maintaining timestamp order.

#### **3. Entering the Critical Section**
- A process $$\( P_i \)$$ enters the critical section if:
   - Its own request is at the front of its local queue.
   - It has received **Reply** messages from all other processes.

#### **4. Releasing the Critical Section**
- After exiting the critical section, $$\( P_i \)$$:
   1. Removes its request from the local queue.
   2. Sends a **Release(T_i, P_i)** message to all other processes.
   3. Each recipient removes $$\( P_i \)$$'s request from their local queue.

### **Properties of Lamport's Algorithm**

1. **Mutual Exclusion**:
   - Only one process can be in the critical section at a time, as requests are processed in timestamp order.

2. **Fairness**:
   - Requests are granted in the order of timestamps, ensuring first-come, first-served access.

3. **No Starvation**:
   - Every process will eventually receive all necessary replies and gain access to the critical section.

### **Message Complexity**

- For $$\( N \)$$ processes:
  - **Request**: $$\( N-1 \)$$ messages.
  - **Replies**: $$\( N-1 \)$$ messages.
  - **Release**: $$\( N-1 \)$$ messages.
- **Total Messages per CS Entry**: $$\( 3(N-1) \)$$.

### **Numerical Example**

#### **System Setup**
- 3 Processes: $$\( P_1 \)$$, $$\( P_2 \)$$, $$\( P_3 \)$$.
- Initial logical clocks: $$\( T_1 = T_2 = T_3 = 0 \)$$.

#### **Scenario**
1. $$\( P_1 \)$$ requests the CS:
   - Sends **Request(1, P_1)** to $$\( P_2 \)$$ and $$\( P_3 \)$$.
   - Local queue of $$\( P_1 \)$$: $$\([Request(1, P_1)]\)$$.

2. $$\( P_2 \)$$ receives **Request(1, P_1)**:
   - Updates $$\( T_2 = \max(T_2, 1) + 1 = 2 \)$$.
   - Sends **Reply(2, P_2)** to $$\( P_1 \)$$.
   - Local queue of $$\( P_2 \)$$: $$\([Request(1, P_1)]\)$$.

3. $$\( P_3 \)$$ receives **Request(1, P_1)**:
   - Updates $$\( T_3 = \max(T_3, 1) + 1 = 2 \)$$.
   - Sends **Reply(2, P_3)** to $$\( P_1 \)$$.
   - Local queue of $$\( P_3 \)$$: $$\([Request(1, P_1)]\)$$.

4. $$\( P_1 \)$$ receives replies from \( P_2 \) and \( P_3 \):
   - Enters the critical section.

5. $$\( P_1 \)$$ exits the CS:
   - Sends **Release(3, P_1)** to $$\( P_2 \)$$ and $$\( P_3 \)$$.
   - All processes remove $$\( Request(1, P_1) \)$$ from their queues.

### **Advantages**
1. Simple to implement with logical clocks.
2. Ensures mutual exclusion, fairness, and no starvation.
3. Works without a central coordinator or token.

### **Disadvantages**
1. High message complexity $$(\( 3(N-1) \))$$.
2. Delays increase with system size due to communication overhead.
3. Vulnerable to process failures.
