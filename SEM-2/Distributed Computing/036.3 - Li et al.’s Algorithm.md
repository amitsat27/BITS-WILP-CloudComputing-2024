Li et al.'s algorithm is an extension of the Lai-Yang algorithm for **non-FIFO systems**. It provides a more general mechanism that accommodates **multiple initiators** and repeated invocations of the global snapshot algorithm. Li et al.'s approach primarily simplifies the computation of channel states by focusing on **message counts** instead of message contents, making the algorithm easier to implement in non-FIFO distributed systems.

### Key Features of Li et al.'s Algorithm:

1. **Generalized Marker Tagging**:
   - The algorithm generalizes the **red/white coloring** scheme from the Lai-Yang algorithm by using tagged markers. Each message and marker in the system is tagged with a tuple:
     - `<init_id, MKNO>`, where `init_id` is the identifier of the initiator of the snapshot, and `MKNO` is the sequence number of the snapshot initiated by `init_id`.
   - This generalization allows the algorithm to handle multiple snapshot initiations by different processes simultaneously, as well as repeated snapshots by the same initiator.

2. **Snapshot Sequence Numbers**:
   - Each snapshot initiated by a process is assigned a **sequence number** (MKNO), which is used to differentiate between successive invocations of the algorithm and ensures that the algorithm can handle overlapping snapshots.
   - Messages sent after a local snapshot is recorded are tagged with the tuple `<init_id, MKNO>`, allowing processes to distinguish between messages sent before and after the snapshot.

3. **Input/Output Counters**:
   - To compute the state of a channel, processes maintain **input/output counters** for each channel.
     - **Input counter**: The number of messages received on a channel after the last snapshot (initiated by a given initiator).
     - **Output counter**: The number of messages sent on a channel after the last snapshot (initiated by a given initiator).
   - These counters are maintained incrementally, meaning only the number of messages sent and received **since the previous snapshot** is tracked.

4. **Channel State Computation**:
   - The state of a channel \(C_{ij}\) is computed by the initiator based on:
     \[
     SC_{ij} = \text{TRANSIT}_{ij} + (\text{\# messages sent by } p_i \text{ since last snapshot}) - (\text{\# messages received by } p_j \text{ since last snapshot})
     \]
   - Here, **TRANSIT\(_{ij}\)** represents the number of messages in transit on channel \(C_{ij}\) during the previous snapshot.

5. **No Additional Control Messages**:
   - Like the Lai-Yang algorithm, Li et al.'s algorithm **does not require explicit marker messages** as long as computation messages are eventually sent over all channels. Instead, the counters are sent along with the local snapshot to the initiator, which collects the global state.

6. **Handling Multiple Initiators**:
   - The algorithm can handle **multiple initiators** by associating a separate set of input/output counters with each initiator. Each initiator keeps track of its own snapshot information, ensuring that snapshots from different initiators are not confused.
   - Markers and messages carry a **vector of tuples**, where each tuple corresponds to a snapshot initiated by a different initiator. This allows processes to correctly associate messages with the appropriate snapshot instance.

7. **Space and Communication Overheads**:
   - The **local storage requirements** and **size of message tags** grow with the number of initiators, i.e., \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of concurrent snapshot initiators.
   - However, **message histories are reduced** by only storing information about messages sent and received since the last snapshot, thus reducing the amount of data transmitted and stored.

8. **Concurrent Snapshots**:
   - The algorithm allows for **concurrent snapshots** initiated by different processes. If a process receives a message with a lower sequence number after already participating in a snapshot initiated later, the algorithm uses the higher sequence number's snapshot information to create the snapshot for the lower sequence number.

9. **Optimization with Spezialetti and Kearns Technique**:
   - Li et al. suggest that the **Spezialetti and Kearns** technique can be used in conjunction with their algorithm to combine snapshots that are initiated concurrently. This helps optimize the algorithm by reducing unnecessary redundancy in snapshot collection.

### Comparison with Lai-Yang Algorithm:

- **Tagging and Multiple Initiators**: Li et al.'s algorithm uses **tuple-based tagging** to handle multiple initiators, while the Lai-Yang algorithm uses a simpler **coloring scheme** (red/white) and does not explicitly handle multiple initiators.
- **Channel State**: Both algorithms compute the state of a channel based on **messages in transit**. However, Li et al. simplify the process by only counting the number of messages in transit (input/output counters) rather than storing entire message histories.
- **Concurrent Snapshots**: Li et al.'s algorithm is designed to handle **concurrent snapshots** initiated by multiple processes, whereas Lai-Yang does not address this scenario directly.

### Summary of Li et al.'s Algorithm:

- **Generalized Markers**: Uses tagged markers `<init_id, MKNO>` instead of colors to track snapshots.
- **Incremental Message Counting**: Processes track the number of messages sent/received since the last snapshot using input/output counters.
- **Concurrent Snapshots**: Can handle multiple initiators and overlapping snapshots by maintaining separate counters and message tags for each initiator.
- **No Extra Messages**: The algorithm doesn't require explicit marker messages unless necessary, reducing communication overhead.
- **Efficient State Calculation**: Channel state is computed based on message counts rather than the entire message history, making the algorithm more space-efficient.

This approach makes the algorithm scalable and suitable for distributed systems with multiple initiators and frequent snapshot invocations.
