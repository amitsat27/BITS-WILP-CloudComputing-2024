### **Maekawa's Algorithm for Distributed Mutual Exclusion**

Maekawa's algorithm is another approach to **distributed mutual exclusion**. It is based on the concept of **voting** among processes, and each process requires votes from a set of other processes before entering the critical section. It is designed to reduce message complexity compared to the previously discussed algorithms like **Ricart-Agrawala**.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Voting Set**:
   - Each process is assigned a **voting set** (a subset of all processes) that it must contact for permission to enter the critical section. 
   - The voting set for each process is constructed so that no two voting sets intersect, ensuring that there is a unique majority of votes for each process in the system.
   - A process needs the majority of votes from its voting set to enter the critical section.

2. **Requesting the Critical Section**:
   - A process sends a **request message** to each process in its voting set when it wishes to enter the critical section.
   
3. **Granting Votes**:
   - A process grants a vote to another process if it is not in the critical section and has no pending request for entering the critical section with a smaller timestamp.

4. **Entering the Critical Section**:
   - A process can enter the critical section only when it has received votes from a majority of its voting set.

5. **Exiting the Critical Section**:
   - After a process exits the critical section, it sends a **release message** to all processes in its voting set, allowing them to vote for other processes.

### **Steps of Maekawa’s Algorithm**

#### **1. Requesting the Critical Section**
When a process `P_i` wants to enter the critical section:
1. It sends a **Request(T_i, P_i)** message to all the processes in its voting set.
2. It waits for the majority of votes (i.e., replies) from the processes in its voting set.

#### **2. Granting the Vote**
When a process `P_j` receives a **Request(T_i, P_i)** message from `P_i`:
- If `P_j` is not in the critical section and has no pending request for entering the critical section with a smaller timestamp:
  1. It sends a **Grant(T_j, P_j)** message to `P_i`.
  2. It adds `P_i`'s request to its local queue.
- If `P_j` is in the critical section or has a pending request with a smaller timestamp, it delays the reply.

#### **3. Entering the Critical Section**
A process `P_i` can enter the critical section if:
1. It has sent a request to all processes in its voting set.
2. It has received a majority of **Grant** messages from its voting set.

#### **4. Exiting the Critical Section**
After `P_i` exits the critical section:
1. It sends a **Release(T_i, P_i)** message to all processes in its voting set.

#### **5. Handling Release Messages**
When a process `P_j` receives a **Release(T_i, P_i)** message:
1. It removes `P_i`'s request from its queue (if it was queued).
2. It updates its local state and can now grant its vote to other processes.

### **Message Complexity**

Let the total number of processes be `N` and the size of the voting set for each process be `V`.

- **Request**: A process sends a request message to `V` processes (its voting set).
- **Grant**: Each process sends a grant message to a process in its voting set if conditions allow.
- **Release**: A process sends a release message to the `V` processes in its voting set.

Thus, the total message complexity for a single entry into the critical section is approximately:
$$ 2V $$ messages (each process sends a request and a reply).

### **Numerical Example**

#### **System Setup**
- 5 processes: `P_1`, `P_2`, `P_3`, `P_4`, `P_5`.
- Each process has a voting set of size 2, for example:
  - `P_1`'s voting set: `{P_2, P_3}`
  - `P_2`'s voting set: `{P_1, P_4}`
  - `P_3`'s voting set: `{P_1, P_5}`
  - `P_4`'s voting set: `{P_2, P_5}`
  - `P_5`'s voting set: `{P_3, P_4}`

#### **Scenario**
1. **Process `P_1`** wants to enter the critical section:
   - Sends **Request(1, P_1)** to `P_2` and `P_3`.
   - Waits for replies from `P_2` and `P_3`.

2. **Process `P_2`** receives **Request(1, P_1)**:
   - Grants a vote and sends **Grant(2, P_2)** to `P_1`.

3. **Process `P_3`** receives **Request(1, P_1)**:
   - Grants a vote and sends **Grant(3, P_3)** to `P_1`.

4. **Process `P_1`** receives votes from `P_2` and `P_3` and enters the critical section.

5. After exiting the critical section, **Process `P_1`** sends **Release(1, P_1)** to `P_2` and `P_3`.

6. **Process `P_2`** and **Process `P_3`** remove `P_1`'s request from their local queues.

### **Advantages**
1. **Reduced Message Complexity**: Compared to algorithms like **Ricart-Agrawala**, Maekawa’s algorithm requires fewer messages for each critical section request (because of the smaller voting set).
2. **Scalability**: As the number of processes increases, the voting set size remains manageable, improving scalability.
3. **Fairness**: The system ensures that all processes get a fair chance to access the critical section, as each process gets a unique voting set.

### **Disadvantages**
1. **Complex Voting Set Design**: Constructing the voting sets without overlaps and ensuring correctness can be complex.
2. **Possible Deadlocks**: If not handled carefully, deadlocks can occur in the system if the voting sets overlap improperly.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: If a process in the voting set fails or is unreachable, the requesting process might be unable to get a majority vote.

### **Comparison to Other Algorithms**

- **Lamport's Algorithm** and **Ricart-Agrawala Algorithm**: Maekawa’s algorithm reduces the number of messages exchanged, especially when compared to the `3(N-1)` message complexity of Ricart-Agrawala.
- **Token-Based Algorithms**: Unlike token-based algorithms, Maekawa’s algorithm requires no central token, providing a more decentralized solution.
