### Definition of a Cut

A **cut** is defined for a distributed system that consists of multiple processes. It includes:

- A set of events from each process, representing the local states of those processes at a specific moment.
- The cut captures the events that have occurred before or up to a specific event in each process.

### Types of Cuts

1. **Global Cut**:
   - A global cut captures events from all processes and represents a potential state of the entire distributed system. 

2. **Causal Cut**:
   - A causal cut is a specific type of global cut that respects the causal relationships between events. If one event causally influences another, the first event must be included in the cut if the second event is included.

### Properties of Consistent Cuts

For a cut to represent a **consistent global state**, it must satisfy the following conditions:

1. **Causal Consistency**:
   - If an event $e_1$ causally affects another event $e_2$, then if $e_2$ is included in the cut, $e_1$ must also be included. This preserves the causal relationships in the system.

2. **No In-Transit Messages**:
   - The cut must not include messages that are in transit at the time of the snapshot. If a message has been sent from one process but has not yet been received by the target process, it should not be part of the global state represented by the cut.

### Example of a Cut

Consider a distributed system with three processes $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$:

- Events in $P_1$: $e_{11}$, $e_{12}$ (where $e_{12}$ is influenced by $e_{11}$)
- Events in $P_2$: $e_{21}$, $e_{22}$
- Events in $P_3$: $e_{31}$

Suppose the following events occur:

- $e_{11}$ happens before $e_{12}$
- $P_1$ sends a message to $P_2$ after $e_{12}$
- $P_2$ receives the message before $e_{21}$

A valid consistent cut could include:

- $e_{11}$ and $e_{12}$ from $P_1$ (because $e_{12}$ causally follows $e_{11}$)
- $e_{21}$ from $P_2$ (received the message)
- $e_{31}$ from $P_3$ (independent of others)

This cut reflects a consistent global state since it respects causality and includes no in-transit messages.

### Summary

In summary, a consistent global state in a distributed system can be represented by a cut that satisfies the conditions of causal consistency and the exclusion of in-transit messages. Cuts help in analyzing and understanding the behavior of distributed systems and play a crucial role in algorithms designed for capturing consistent snapshots of the system's state.
