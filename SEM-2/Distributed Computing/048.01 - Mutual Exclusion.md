**Mutual Exclusion** is a concept in computer science, particularly in the field of concurrent programming, to ensure that multiple processes or threads do not simultaneously access shared resources, like data or memory, in a way that causes conflicts or inconsistencies.

### Key Points:
1. **Purpose**:
   - To prevent *race conditions*, where the outcome depends on the sequence or timing of processes.
   - Ensures data integrity when multiple entities try to modify shared resources.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Achieved using synchronization mechanisms such as:
     - **Locks**: A thread must acquire a lock before accessing a resource.
     - **Semaphores**: Counters to control access based on limits.
     - **Monitors**: High-level abstraction for managing access.

3. **Critical Section**:
   - A segment of code that accesses shared resources. Mutual exclusion ensures only one process executes this section at a time.

4. **Challenges**:
   - **Deadlock**: When two or more processes wait indefinitely for resources locked by each other.
   - **Starvation**: When some processes never get access to the resource.
   - **Overhead**: Adding mutual exclusion mechanisms can slow down systems.

### Example:
Suppose two threads are updating a bank account balance. Without mutual exclusion, one thread might overwrite the other's changes, causing incorrect data. Using a lock ensures only one thread updates the balance at a time, preserving accuracy.
