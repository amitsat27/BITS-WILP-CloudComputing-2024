### Uniform Algorithms

**Definition**:
- A **uniform algorithm** is one that does not incorporate \( n \), the total number of processes in the system, as a parameter in its code. This means that the algorithm's logic and behavior remain constant regardless of how many processes are currently active.

### Characteristics:
1. **Scalability Transparency**:
   - Uniform algorithms can adapt to changes in the number of processes without requiring modifications to their structure or logic. This enhances scalability, as processes can join or leave the system seamlessly.

2. **Localized Impact**:
   - The departure or arrival of a process affects only its immediate neighbors in the topology. Other processes remain unaware of these changes, maintaining overall system stability.

3. **Communication Topology**:
   - Commonly found in systems where processes operate in a logical ring and communicate only with their immediate neighbors. This local communication pattern allows for uniform behavior without needing to know the total number of processes.

### Benefits:
- **Flexibility**: The ability to scale without needing to alter the algorithm makes uniform algorithms suitable for dynamic distributed systems.
- **Simplicity**: By avoiding dependencies on the number of processes, these algorithms can be simpler to design and implement.

### Example Use Cases:
- **Logical Ring Algorithms**: Algorithms that operate in a logical ring topology, where each process interacts only with its adjacent neighbors, exemplify uniform algorithms. They can efficiently manage tasks like leader election or resource sharing without needing to know the total number of participants.
