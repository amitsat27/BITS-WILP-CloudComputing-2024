The **non-FIFO algorithm by Helary** is designed to take consistent snapshots in distributed systems where the communication channels are **non-FIFO** (i.e., messages between processes may not arrive in the order they were sent). The algorithm addresses the challenge of taking a consistent snapshot by using **message inhibition** to temporarily delay the execution of the processes when necessary, ensuring that the in-transit messages are correctly accounted for.

### Key Idea of Helary’s Algorithm

Helary’s algorithm relies on **message inhibition** to handle non-FIFO channels. The idea is that when a process receives a snapshot marker, it temporarily inhibits the processing of application messages. This allows the algorithm to ensure that the messages in transit at the time of the snapshot are properly recorded, even if the messages are received out of order.

### Steps in Helary’s Non-FIFO Snapshot Algorithm

1. **Snapshot Initiation**:
   - Similar to the Chandy-Lamport algorithm, the snapshot is initiated by one process (let’s call it **P1**), which records its local state and sends a **marker** to all other processes (let's call them **P2, P3**, etc.) along all its outgoing communication channels.
   
2. **Receiving a Marker and Inhibiting Messages**:
   - When another process (say **P2**) receives the marker for the first time, it:
     1. **Records its local state**.
     2. **Inhibits (delays) the processing of computation messages** arriving on its incoming channels.
     3. **Sends markers** along its outgoing communication channels to inform other processes that a snapshot is in progress.
   
3. **Channel State Recording**:
   - After the marker is received by **P2**, all computation messages that arrive on the incoming channels of **P2** are delayed and buffered (inhibited). This is crucial for ensuring that the process can correctly record the state of these channels. 
   - Any message that is delayed is considered **in transit** during the snapshot, as it was sent before the snapshot but received after the marker.
   - The state of an incoming channel is recorded as the set of all messages that were buffered (delayed) after the marker was received and before the snapshot was completed.

4. **Resuming Message Processing**:
   - Once a process (like **P2**) has recorded its local state and the state of all its incoming channels, it resumes normal message processing. The delayed messages are processed, and any additional markers that are received are ignored since the process has already recorded its state.

5. **Completion**:
   - The snapshot is complete when all processes have recorded their local states and all channels' states have been determined. At this point, the global snapshot of the system has been captured consistently.

### Example of Helary’s Algorithm

Let’s consider a distributed system with three processes (**P1**, **P2**, and **P3**) and non-FIFO channels between them.

- **Step 1: Snapshot Initiation by P1**:
   - **P1** initiates the snapshot, records its local state, and sends markers to **P2** and **P3**.

- **Step 2: P2 Receives the Marker**:
   - **P2** receives the marker from **P1**, records its local state, and **inhibits (delays)** processing of messages arriving on its incoming channels (from **P1** and **P3**).
   - **P2** sends a marker to **P3**.
   
- **Step 3: Recording Channel States**:
   - While **P2** is inhibiting incoming messages, any message arriving from **P1** or **P3** that was sent before the snapshot marker is delayed.
   - **P2** records the state of its incoming channels as all messages that are delayed while it was inhibiting.

- **Step 4: P3 Receives Markers**:
   - **P3** receives markers from both **P1** and **P2**, records its local state, and similarly inhibits processing of incoming messages.
   - After recording the state of its channels, **P3** resumes message processing.

### Advantages of Helary’s Algorithm

- **Consistent Snapshot in Non-FIFO Systems**: Helary’s use of message inhibition ensures that the state of each process and its incoming channels is captured consistently, even when messages are delivered out of order.
- **Simple Mechanism**: By temporarily inhibiting message processing, the algorithm avoids the need for complex tracking of message sequences or causality between messages.

### Limitations

- **Performance Overhead**: Since the algorithm delays the processing of messages during the snapshot, it introduces performance overhead. This can impact system responsiveness, especially if the inhibition period is long or there are frequent snapshots.
- **Blocking**: The inhibition (delaying) of messages effectively blocks parts of the system during the snapshot, which could reduce the system’s throughput during that period.

### Comparison to Piggybacking Algorithms

Helary’s algorithm uses **inhibition** to ensure that the state of channels is recorded correctly, whereas piggybacking-based algorithms (such as Lai-Yang or Mattern's) attach extra information to messages to track whether they were sent before or after a snapshot marker. The **message inhibition** approach is simpler but may introduce more delays, while **message piggybacking** adds some communication overhead but can allow more efficient snapshot collection.

### Conclusion

Helary’s non-FIFO snapshot algorithm is a reliable way to capture a consistent global state in systems with non-FIFO channels. It uses message inhibition to avoid the complexities of out-of-order message delivery, ensuring that the snapshot is consistent and correctly reflects all the messages in transit at the time of the snapshot. However, it does so at the cost of performance, as the inhibition mechanism introduces delays in processing application messages.
