The **Minimum Weight Spanning Tree (MST)** problem in an asynchronous system can be more challenging than in a synchronous setting due to the lack of coordinated timing between the nodes. This means that different nodes can send and receive messages at different times, which can lead to issues in ensuring that all nodes have consistent views of the tree structure and the edges involved.

Here’s a detailed look at the two approaches for designing an asynchronous MST algorithm, particularly focusing on the **GHS algorithm** (Gallager-Humblet-Spira), which is commonly used for constructing MSTs.

### 1. Simulation of Synchronous GHS in an Asynchronous Setting

The first approach involves simulating the synchronous GHS algorithm while adding extra protocol steps to handle the challenges of asynchrony. Here are the key mechanisms:

#### a. Broadcasting and Convergecasting

- **Broadcast and Convergecast**: After each round of processing, the newly identified leader broadcasts its ID and round number on the tree edges. The leaves of the tree then send back acknowledgments through a process known as convergecasting.
- **Delaying Responses**: If a node receives an EXAMINE message from a different round, it delays its response. This effectively enforces a level of synchrony because nodes will respond only when they are ready, based on their current round.
- **Message Complexity**: This method incurs an additional cost of \(O(n \cdot \log(n))\) extra messages due to the overhead of broadcasts and acknowledgments.

#### b. Informing Neighbors of New Levels

- **Informing Neighbors**: When a node starts a new round, it informs its neighbors (accessible via unmarked or non-tree edges) about its new level. However, it only sends EXAMINE messages after confirming that all neighbors along unmarked edges are in the same round.
- **Message Complexity**: This method costs \(O(|L| \cdot \log(n))\) extra messages, where \(L\) represents the set of marked edges. 

### 2. Original Asynchronous GHS Algorithm

The second approach to building an asynchronous MST directly addresses the issues arising from the lack of synchrony. This approach is more complex and is designed to manage the asynchronous nature effectively. Here are some of the intricacies involved:

#### a. Identifying Components and Levels

- **Different Components**: The algorithm must have a mechanism to determine if two nodes belong to different components or levels. This is critical for ensuring that messages are processed correctly.
- **Combining Components**: If nodes at different levels are allowed to combine components, there’s a risk of a single-node component being repeatedly merged with larger components, which could degrade efficiency.

#### b. Coordinating the Search for Minimum Weight Edges (MWOEs)

- **Concurrent Searches**: The algorithm needs to carefully coordinate the search for minimum weight edges (MWOEs) by adjacent components at different levels. This requires clear rules for merging components and how to handle concurrent searches.

### Message and Time Complexity

Despite the additional complexities, the asynchronous GHS algorithm aims to achieve similar efficiency to its synchronous counterpart:

- **Message Complexity**: The overall message complexity is \(O(n \cdot \log(n) + l)\), where \(l\) is the number of edges in the graph.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(n \cdot \log(n) \cdot (l + d))\), where \(d\) is the diameter of the graph.

### Summary

- The asynchronous MST algorithms, particularly those based on the GHS method, introduce complexities related to the asynchrony of message passing.
- Two main approaches exist: simulating the synchronous version with added control messages and developing an original asynchronous algorithm that tackles these challenges head-on.
- Achieving efficient communication and coordination among nodes is critical for ensuring the correctness and efficiency of the MST construction in an asynchronous environment.
