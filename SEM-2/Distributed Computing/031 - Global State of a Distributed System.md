The **global state of a distributed system** refers to the collective state of all processes and communication channels at a specific point in time. It captures the current status of the entire system, which is useful for debugging, checkpointing, and monitoring in distributed applications. However, obtaining a consistent global state in a distributed system is challenging due to the lack of a global clock and the inherent asynchronous nature of distributed systems.

### Components of a Global State

1. **Local States of Processes**:
   - The state of each individual process in the system, which includes variables, registers, program counters, etc.
   - Each process runs independently, and its local state can change over time.

2. **States of Communication Channels**:
   - The messages that are currently in transit between processes. These messages are typically held in communication channels, such as network buffers or message queues.

### Challenges in Capturing Global State

- **No Global Clock**: There is no global physical or logical clock shared by all processes, making it impossible to capture the exact state of the system at a specific moment in time.
  
- **Concurrent Events**: Processes may be executing concurrently, and their states can change between the time it takes to gather the local states from all processes.

- **In-transit Messages**: Messages sent by one process may not yet have been received by another process, complicating the capture of the system's communication state.

### Consistent Global State

A **consistent global state** is one where the captured states of the processes and communication channels are mutually consistent. Specifically, it should reflect a possible execution of the system where:

- **No causality violations occur**: If one event (e.g., a message being sent) causally affects another event (e.g., the message being received), the global state must reflect this causal relationship.

### Capturing Global State: The Chandy-Lamport Algorithm

The **Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm** is one of the most well-known methods for capturing a consistent global state in a distributed system. It works for systems that communicate through reliable, FIFO (First In, First Out) communication channels.

#### Steps of the Chandy-Lamport Algorithm

1. **Marker Messages**:
   - One process, called the **initiator**, starts the snapshot by recording its local state and sending a special **marker message** to all other processes.
   - Upon receiving a marker message, a process records its local state and sends marker messages to its neighboring processes if it has not already done so.

2. **Recording States of Channels**:
   - When a process receives a marker for the first time, it records its local state and starts recording all incoming messages from other processes on channels that have not yet sent a marker. These recorded messages represent the state of the communication channel before the snapshot.
   - After sending its own marker, a process stops recording messages from processes that have already sent markers.

3. **Completion of Snapshot**:
   - Once all processes have received markers and recorded their local states and the states of their incoming channels, the global state can be reconstructed by combining the local states and the channel states.

#### Example

Consider a distributed system with three processes $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$, and two communication channels $C_{12}$ and $C_{23}$. Here’s how the Chandy-Lamport algorithm would work:

- **Step 1**: $P_1$ initiates the snapshot and records its local state. It sends marker messages to $P_2$ and $P_3$.
- **Step 2**: $P_2$ receives the marker from $P_1$, records its local state, and starts recording messages coming through $C_{12}$. It then sends marker messages to $P_1$ and $P_3$.
- **Step 3**: $P_3$ receives the marker, records its local state, and starts recording incoming messages through $C_{23}$. It sends marker messages to $P_1$ and $P_2$.

Once all processes have recorded their local states and channel states, the global state can be determined.

### Example of an Inconsistent Global State

Consider a situation where $P_1$ sends a message to $P_2$. If $P_1$ records its local state after sending the message, but $P_2$ records its state before receiving the message, the global state may falsely reflect that the message is still in transit, even though it has already been sent and received.

### Applications of Global State

1. **Checkpointing**:
   - Capturing global states is crucial for **checkpointing**, where the system saves its state periodically. This allows the system to recover from failures by rolling back to a previous consistent state.
  
2. **Deadlock Detection**:
   - A consistent global state helps in detecting deadlocks, where processes are waiting on each other indefinitely.
  
3. **Debugging and Monitoring**:
   - The global state can be used to observe the system’s behavior and diagnose issues like performance bottlenecks or protocol violations.

4. **Snapshot-based Algorithms**:
   - Various distributed algorithms, such as algorithms for detecting stable properties (like termination), rely on capturing a consistent global state.

### Conclusion

The global state of a distributed system provides a snapshot of the entire system at a particular logical point in time, encompassing the local states of processes and the states of communication channels. Capturing this state consistently is crucial for many distributed applications, such as checkpointing, deadlock detection, and monitoring. Algorithms like the Chandy-Lamport snapshot ensure that the global state is captured without violating causality, even in asynchronous systems.
