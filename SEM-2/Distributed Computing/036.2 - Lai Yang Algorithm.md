The **Lai-Yang algorithm** for global snapshots in **non-FIFO systems** uses a **coloring scheme** and a set of rules to ensure a consistent global state without the need for explicit marker messages. The algorithm leverages the idea that the "marker" in FIFO systems helps maintain certain consistency conditions (like those in Chandy-Lamport), and in non-FIFO systems, this role is fulfilled through message coloring and histories.

### Key Concepts in Lai-Yang's Algorithm

1. **Coloring Scheme**: 
   - Every process starts as **white** and turns **red** when it records its local snapshot.
   - All messages sent before a process turns red are **white messages**, while messages sent after it turns red are **red messages**.
   - This coloring helps distinguish between messages sent before and after the snapshot.

2. **Snapshot Recording**:
   - Each process can take its local snapshot **at its convenience** but must record it **before** processing a **red message** (a message sent by a process after it has recorded its snapshot).

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initial State**:
   - Every process is initially white, and as part of the snapshot process, they will eventually turn red.
   
2. **Sending Messages**:
   - A white process sends **white-colored messages** until it takes its snapshot and turns red, after which it sends **red-colored messages**.

3. **Local Snapshot**:
   - A white process records its local state before processing any red message, ensuring no message sent after a snapshot is processed before the destination process also records its snapshot.

4. **Message Histories**:
   - Every white process keeps track of all **white messages** it sends or receives over each communication channel.
   - When a process turns red, it sends these histories (the record of all white messages sent or received) to the **initiator** process (the one that initiated the snapshot), which will use them to compute the global snapshot.

5. **Global Snapshot Collection**:
   - The initiator process gathers the local snapshots and the histories of messages sent or received.
   - The state of a channel $\( C_{ij} \)$ (the messages in transit) is calculated as the difference between the **white messages sent by process i** and the **white messages received by process j**.
   
   $\[
   SC_{ij} = \text{(white messages sent by } p_i \text{ on } C_{ij}) - \text{(white messages received by } p_j \text{ on } C_{ij})
   \]$

### Ensuring Consistency

The algorithm ensures the consistency of the global snapshot by fulfilling two key conditions:

- **Condition C1**: Any white message sent by process $\( i \)$ to process $\( j \)$ is included either in the snapshot of $\( j \)$ (if it is received before $\( j \)$ takes its snapshot) or in the state of the channel $\( C_{ij} \)$ (if it arrives after $\( j \)$ records its snapshot but was sent before $\( i \)$ turned red).
  
- **Condition C2**: Red messages (messages sent after a process records its snapshot) are not included in the snapshot of the recipient process, which prevents inconsistencies.

### Space Requirements and Optimization

While this algorithm avoids the overhead of explicit marker messages, it requires each process to maintain **message histories** for each communication channel. This can lead to high space requirements, especially in systems with frequent messaging or large numbers of messages in transit.

However, Lai and Yang suggest optimizations:
- **Integer Counters**: Instead of recording each message, integer counters can be used to track the number of messages sent and received, which significantly reduces space requirements.
- **Incremental Snapshots**: In systems that require repeated snapshots, only the messages sent and received since the previous snapshot need to be stored, assuming the previous snapshot is still available. This reduces the amount of storage needed for each new snapshot.

### Summary of the Lai-Yang Algorithm:

- **Coloring Scheme**: Processes and messages are colored white (pre-snapshot) and red (post-snapshot).
- **Local Snapshots**: Processes record their local states before processing any red message.
- **Message Histories**: Processes track white messages sent and received to determine the channel states.
- **No Explicit Markers**: The "marker" in this algorithm is implicit and piggybacked using the coloring scheme, avoiding extra control messages.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizations, such as integer counters and incremental snapshots, help reduce space usage in systems that need multiple snapshots.

The Lai-Yang algorithm is highly efficient for **non-FIFO distributed systems** and is particularly useful in situations like **termination detection**, where tracking message transit is essential for maintaining a consistent global state.
