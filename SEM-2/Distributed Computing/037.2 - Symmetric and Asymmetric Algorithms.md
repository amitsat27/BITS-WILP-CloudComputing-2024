In distributed systems, **symmetric algorithms** and **asymmetric algorithms** refer to how processors or nodes in the system execute their tasks.

### 1. **Symmetric Algorithms**:
   - All processors or nodes execute the **same logical functions** in a **symmetrical** way.
   - There is no distinction in the roles of the processors, and each follows identical instructions and operations.
   
   #### Example Use Case:
   - A fully distributed system where all nodes perform the same operations, such as in a ring or mesh topology.

### 2. **Asymmetric Algorithms**:
   - Different processors execute **logically different functions**. These functions may overlap but are generally distinct in terms of their roles in the algorithm.
   - Asymmetric algorithms are common in systems where roles differ by necessity, such as client-server systems or hierarchical systems.

   #### Example Use Case:
   - **Client-Server Configuration**: Clients and servers execute different functionsâ€”clients request data or services, and the server processes those requests.
   - **Tree Configuration**: The root node, internal nodes, and leaf nodes often have distinct responsibilities (e.g., root handles coordination, leaves handle data storage).

Inherently asymmetric systems, such as **centralized algorithms** where one node coordinates the activities of others, will always involve asymmetric algorithms.
