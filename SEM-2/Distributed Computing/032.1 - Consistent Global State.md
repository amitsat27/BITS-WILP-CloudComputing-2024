The conditions provided below are used to determine whether a global state $\( GS \)$ is a consistent global state in a distributed system. Let's break down the two conditions $\( C1 \)$ and $\( C2 \)$ to understand their meanings.

### Notation

- $LS_i$: The local state of process $P_i$.
- $SC_{ij}$: The state of the communication channel between processes $P_i$ and $P_j$.
- $send(m_{ij})$: An event where process $P_i$ sends a message $m_{ij}$ to process $P_j$.
- $rec(m_{ij})$: An event where process $P_j$ receives the message $m_{ij}$.
- $\oplus$: The XOR operator.

### Condition C1

**Condition**: 
$$send(m_{ij}) \in LS_i \Rightarrow m_{ij} \in SC_{ij} \oplus rec(m_{ij}) \in LS_j$$

**Interpretation**:
- This condition states that if process $P_i$ has sent a message $m_{ij}$ (i.e., $send(m_{ij})$ is part of the local state $LS_i$), then either:
  - The message $m_{ij}$ must be part of the channel state $SC_{ij}$ (meaning it has been sent but not necessarily received), or
  - The message $m_{ij}$ has been received by $P_j$ (i.e., $rec(m_{ij})$ is part of the local state $LS_j$).

The XOR operator $\oplus$ indicates that **only one of these conditions** must hold, but not both simultaneously. This ensures that if $P_i$ has sent a message, it should either be in transit (in the channel state) or already received by $P_j$, but not both.

### Condition C2

**Condition**: 
$$send(m_{ij}) \notin LS_i \Rightarrow m_{ij} \notin SC_{ij} \land rec(m_{ij}) \notin LS_j$$

**Interpretation**:
- This condition states that if process $P_i$ has **not** sent the message $m_{ij}$ (i.e., $send(m_{ij})$ is not part of the local state $LS_i$), then:
  - The message $m_{ij}$ must **not** be in the channel state $SC_{ij}$ (meaning it was not sent and is not in transit), and
  - The message $m_{ij}$ must **not** be received by process $P_j$ (i.e., $rec(m_{ij})$ is not part of the local state $LS_j$).

### Summary

In summary, for a global state $GS$ to be consistent:

- **C1** ensures that if a message has been sent, it should either be reflected as being in the channel or acknowledged as received by the other process, but not both.
- **C2** ensures that if a message has **not** been sent by $P_i$, it should neither appear in the channel state as in transit nor be recorded as received by $P_j$.

These conditions together help maintain the causal relationships between events in a distributed system, ensuring that the global state accurately reflects the system's behavior.
