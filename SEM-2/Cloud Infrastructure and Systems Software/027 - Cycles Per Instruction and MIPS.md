### **Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) and MIPS Calculation**

**Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)** and **Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS)** are two important metrics used to measure the performance of a CPU. Here’s a detailed explanation along with examples of how to calculate them.

### **1. Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)**

**CPI** indicates the average number of clock cycles required to execute one instruction. A lower CPI means better performance as it indicates fewer cycles are needed per instruction.

#### **Formula:**
$\[
\text{CPI} = \frac{\text{Total Clock Cycles}}{\text{Total Instructions Executed}}
\]$

#### **Example Calculation of CPI:**

Suppose a program executes a total of 1,000,000 instructions and the CPU takes a total of 2,500,000 clock cycles to execute these instructions.

1. **Total Clock Cycles**: 2,500,000
2. **Total Instructions Executed**: 1,000,000

Using the CPI formula:
$\[
\text{CPI} = \frac{2,500,000}{1,000,000} = 2.5
\]$

**Interpretation**: On average, it takes 2.5 clock cycles to execute each instruction in this example.

### **2. Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS)**

**MIPS** measures how many millions of instructions a CPU can execute in one second. It provides a general sense of performance but does not consider the complexity of the instructions.

#### **Formula:**
$\[
\text{MIPS} = \frac{\text{Clock Rate (in MHz)}}{\text{CPI}}
\]$
or
$\[
\text{MIPS} = \frac{\text{Total Instructions Executed}}{\text{Execution Time (in seconds)} \times 10^6}
\]$

#### **Example Calculation of MIPS:**

Using the previous example, let’s assume the CPU has a clock speed of 2 GHz (or 2000 MHz).

1. **Clock Rate**: 2000 MHz
2. **CPI**: 2.5

Using the MIPS formula:
$\[
\text{MIPS} = \frac{2000}{2.5} = 800
\]$

**Interpretation**: The CPU can execute 800 million instructions per second.

### **Combined Example:**

Let’s put both calculations together in a more complex example.

#### **Scenario:**
- A CPU executes a program with the following characteristics:
  - **Total Clock Cycles**: 4,000,000
  - **Total Instructions Executed**: 1,600,000
  - **Clock Speed**: 3 GHz (or 3000 MHz)

#### **Step 1: Calculate CPI**
Using the CPI formula:
$\[
\text{CPI} = \frac{4,000,000}{1,600,000} = 2.5
\]$

#### **Step 2: Calculate MIPS**
Using the MIPS formula:
$\[
\text{MIPS} = \frac{3000}{2.5} = 1200
\]$

### **Final Results:**
- **CPI**: 2.5 (average of 2.5 clock cycles per instruction)
- **MIPS**: 1200 (can execute 1200 million instructions per second)

### **Conclusion**

CPI and MIPS are crucial for understanding CPU performance. While CPI helps indicate how efficiently instructions are executed, MIPS provides a general throughput measure. It's essential to analyze both metrics together to get a complete picture of a CPU's performance capabilities.
