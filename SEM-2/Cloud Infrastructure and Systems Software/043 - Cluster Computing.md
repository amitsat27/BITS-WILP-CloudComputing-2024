Cluster computing is a system where multiple computers, either tightly or loosely connected, work together to perform tasks as if they were a single unit. These connected computers, often called nodes, coordinate their efforts to execute operations simultaneously. The aim is to create a unified system where tasks are distributed across the cluster, making the overall process more efficient.

The individual computers (nodes) in a cluster are typically connected through high-speed local area networks (LANs) to ensure quick communication and data transfer. By combining the power of multiple machines, cluster computing can handle large-scale computations and workloads that a single computer might struggle with.

Key benefits of cluster computing include:

1. **Scalability**: New nodes can be added to the cluster to increase processing power.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: If one node fails, the others can continue to function, improving the system's reliability.
3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Clusters can use commodity hardware, which is cheaper than large supercomputers.

Cluster computing is commonly used in applications that require high processing power, such as scientific simulations, data analysis, and big data processing.
