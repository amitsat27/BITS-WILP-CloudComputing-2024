A **Docker container layer** is a concept that stems from Docker's use of a **Union File System (UFS)** to manage container storage. Docker uses a layered file system to build and manage containers, where each layer represents changes or additions made at different stages of the container's lifecycle.

Here’s how the **Docker container layer** works:

### 1. **Image Layers**
When a Docker image is created, it is built in layers. Each layer represents a set of changes to the file system, such as adding files, installing packages, or setting environment variables. These layers are **read-only** and stacked on top of each other.

For example, if you're building an image using a Dockerfile:
- The **FROM** statement (base image) adds a layer.
- Each **RUN**, **COPY**, or **ADD** command in the Dockerfile adds a new layer.
  
### 2. **Container Layer**
When a container is created from an image, Docker creates an additional **read-write layer** on top of the image layers. This layer is unique to the container, meaning any changes made while the container is running (like creating files, modifying data, etc.) are written to this topmost container layer.

### Key Points about Container Layers:
- **Read-Write Layer**: This is the only layer that is writable, and it is where any changes made while the container is running will be stored. When the container is stopped or deleted, the data in this layer can be lost unless persisted with volumes.
- **Image Layers are Read-Only**: The underlying image layers are immutable and cannot be changed. They are shared between containers that use the same image, which reduces disk usage.
- **Union File System**: Docker uses UFS to combine all these layers into a single coherent file system, allowing the container to appear as if it is a single file system, even though it’s built from multiple layers.

### 3. **Layer Sharing and Caching**
- **Layer Reusability**: Since image layers are read-only, they can be shared between different containers to save space and improve efficiency. For instance, if multiple containers are built from the same base image, they can reuse the same base image layers.
- **Layer Caching**: Docker caches the layers during image builds, which means if a layer hasn't changed from a previous build, Docker will use the cached version to speed up the build process.

### 4. **Benefits of Layers**
- **Efficiency**: By reusing existing layers, Docker minimizes the amount of data that needs to be stored and transferred.
- **Modularity**: Each change to an image results in a new layer, making it easier to track and manage changes over time.
  
### 5. **Managing Data: Volumes and Bind Mounts**
To persist data beyond the lifecycle of a container, Docker uses **volumes** or **bind mounts**, which are external to the container's writable layer. This ensures data can survive container restarts or deletion.

### Example:
Consider the following Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
COPY . /var/www/html
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- **Layer 1**: `FROM ubuntu:20.04` – This pulls the base Ubuntu image.
- **Layer 2**: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx` – This adds a new layer where Nginx is installed.
- **Layer 3**: `COPY . /var/www/html` – This adds the current directory’s content into the container.
- **Layer 4**: When a container is created from this image, Docker adds a read-write layer on top of these three image layers.

### Conclusion:
In Docker, each container has a top writable layer where modifications are made, while all the underlying layers are read-only. The layering system allows Docker to be lightweight, efficient, and modular, enabling reuse of components and speeding up processes like building and running containers.
