Interrupts are signals that inform the CPU about events that require immediate attention, allowing the CPU to temporarily halt its current operations and address the event. They are crucial for efficient I/O operations and multitasking in modern computing systems. Here are the main classes of interrupts:

### 1. **Hardware Interrupts**
- **Definition**: Generated by hardware devices to signal that they need processing.
- **Examples**:
  - **I/O Device Interrupts**: Generated by peripherals (e.g., keyboard, mouse, disk drives) when they require attention, such as when a key is pressed or data is ready to be read.
  - **Timer Interrupts**: Generated by hardware timers to signal the CPU to perform tasks at regular intervals (e.g., for scheduling).
  
### 2. **Software Interrupts**
- **Definition**: Generated by software programs, typically via specific instructions.
- **Examples**:
  - **System Calls**: Requests by a program for services provided by the operating system (e.g., file access, memory allocation).
  - **Exceptions**: Generated when the CPU encounters an unexpected condition during execution, such as:
    - **Arithmetic Errors**: Division by zero, overflow errors.
    - **Invalid Operations**: Attempting to execute illegal instructions.

### 3. **External Interrupts**
- **Definition**: Interrupts that come from external sources, such as hardware devices outside the CPU.
- **Examples**:
  - **Peripheral Device Requests**: Signals from devices like printers or network cards needing CPU processing.
  - **Power Failure Signals**: Notifications from power management hardware.

### 4. **Internal Interrupts**
- **Definition**: Interrupts that occur within the CPU due to the execution of instructions.
- **Examples**:
  - **Exceptions**: As mentioned earlier, these include conditions like illegal instructions or page faults that occur during program execution.
  
### 5. **Maskable and Non-Maskable Interrupts**
- **Maskable Interrupts**: Can be ignored or "masked" by the CPU if it is currently executing a higher-priority task. This allows the CPU to prioritize certain tasks over others.
  
- **Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMI)**: Cannot be ignored or masked. They are typically used for critical events, such as hardware failures or emergency stop signals, ensuring immediate attention.

### Summary
Interrupts play a vital role in computer systems by enabling efficient handling of asynchronous events. Understanding the different classes of interrupts helps in designing responsive and robust systems, allowing the CPU to prioritize tasks effectively and manage resources efficiently.
