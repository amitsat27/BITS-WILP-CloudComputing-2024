- **Scalability:** Check the ability to scale up and down dynamically.
- **Global Reach:** Presence of data centers and edge locations in relevant regions.

---

### ◼ **Cost**
- **Pricing Structure:** Understand pay-as-you-go, reserved instances, spot pricing, and savings plans.
- **Cost Predictability:** Evaluate tools for budgeting and forecasting (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management).
- **Hidden Fees:** Check for charges on data egress, API calls, and management services.
- **Free Tier Offerings:** Assess the value of introductory credits or free-tier usage.

---

### ◼ **Security**
- **Data Encryption:** Ensure encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- **Access Control:** Support for robust Identity and Access Management (IAM).
- **Compliance Certifications:** Verify certifications like GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and SOC 2.
- **Threat Detection:** Availability of real-time monitoring and automated threat responses.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Built-in features for disaster recovery and snapshots.

---

### ◼ **Availability & Reliability**
- **Uptime Guarantees:** Check Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for uptime (e.g., 99.99% availability).
- **Disaster Recovery:** Ensure redundancy and failover mechanisms across regions.
- **Past Downtime Incidents:** Research the provider's history of outages and resolution times.

---

### ◼ **Ease of Use**
- **User Interface (UI):** Assess the intuitiveness of the management console.
- **APIs and SDKs:** Check the availability of APIs for automation and third-party integrations.
- **Documentation:** Quality and comprehensiveness of guides, tutorials, and FAQs.
- **Training Resources:** Availability of certification programs and learning portals.

---

### ◼ **Features & Services**
- **Compute:** Variety of instance types (e.g., general-purpose, compute-optimized, GPU).
- **Storage:** Options for object, block, and file storage with tiering capabilities.
- **Database:** Managed services for relational, NoSQL, and in-memory databases.
- **AI/ML Tools:** Native machine learning and AI services (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI).
- **Edge & IoT Support:** Integration with edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

---

### ◼ **Compliance and Governance**
- **Data Residency:** Ability to specify the region where data is stored and processed.
- **Audit Trails:** Tools for logging and monitoring resource changes.
- **Resource Tagging:** Support for tagging resources for governance and cost tracking.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Centralized tools for compliance management.

---

### ◼ **Support and Community**
- **Customer Support Plans:** Evaluate tiers (e.g., free, developer, business, enterprise).
- **Community Support:** Size and activity of the provider's developer community and forums.
- **Response Time:** Guaranteed response times for technical issues.
- **Local Expertise:** Availability of regional partners or managed service providers.

---

### ◼ **Interoperability**
- **Multi-Cloud Compatibility:** Ease of integrating with other cloud platforms.
- **Hybrid Cloud Support:** Features for combining on-premises infrastructure with the cloud.
- **Standards and APIs:** Support for open standards and APIs for portability.

---

### ◼ **Innovation & Roadmap**
- **New Services:** Frequency and relevance of new feature rollouts.
- **AI/ML and Automation:** Advanced services for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and workflow automation.
- **Edge and Quantum Computing:** Availability of next-generation technologies.

---

### ◼ **Vendor Lock-In**
- **Proprietary Services:** Consider reliance on tools that limit portability.
- **Migration Tools:** Availability of resources to move workloads to and from the provider.
- **Exit Strategy:** Evaluate how easy it is to migrate away if needed.

---

### ◼ **Environmental Impact**
- **Sustainability Goals:** Commitment to renewable energy and carbon-neutral operations.
- **Green Certifications:** Verify claims with certifications like ISO 14001.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Provider’s efforts to minimize the environmental footprint of data centers.
