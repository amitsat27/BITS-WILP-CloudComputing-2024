A **Docker container** is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application, such as the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Containers are isolated from one another and the underlying infrastructure, ensuring consistent operation across different environments, whether it's development, testing, or production.

### Key Features of Docker Containers:
1. **Isolation**: Containers run independently from each other, providing process isolation and security. They share the host system’s kernel but keep everything else isolated, including file systems and network configurations.
   
2. **Portability**: Since Docker containers include all the dependencies of an application, they can be run consistently across any environment that supports Docker, such as local machines, cloud environments, or servers.

3. **Lightweight**: Containers are lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines (VMs) because they share the host OS’s kernel. This reduces resource usage and improves performance.

4. **Fast Startup**: Containers start almost instantly because they do not require booting a full operating system, as in the case of VMs.

5. **Immutable**: Docker containers are immutable, meaning once built, they don't change unless rebuilt. This ensures the application behaves consistently.

### Structure of a Docker Container:
- **Application**: The code or application logic to be executed.
- **Dependencies**: All libraries, binaries, and other dependencies required to run the application.
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and configuration files.
- **Docker Image**: A Docker container is instantiated from a Docker image, which is a read-only template that defines how the container will be created.

### Example Use Case:
For instance, if you have a web application running in a container, all its components (the web server, application code, libraries) are bundled inside the container. You can run this container on any machine with Docker installed, ensuring it behaves the same way across different environments.

### How Docker Containers Differ from Virtual Machines:
- **Containers** share the host OS kernel, while each **VM** runs its own OS.
- Containers are more efficient in terms of resource usage and performance compared to VMs, which are more heavyweight and require more overhead.
