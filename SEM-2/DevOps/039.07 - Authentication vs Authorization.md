**Authentication** and **Authorization** are two distinct concepts in the field of security and identity management, but they are closely related and often used together in systems to control access. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each:

### **Authentication**
- **Definition**: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. It is essentially about asking "Who are you?" and ensuring the person or system is who they claim to be.
- **Goal**: To confirm that the entity is legitimate and to allow them access to the system based on their identity.
- **How it works**: 
  - Authentication typically involves verifying something the user knows (password), something the user has (security token, smartcard), or something the user is (biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition).
  - **Common authentication methods** include:
    - **Password-based**: The user provides a password to verify their identity.
    - **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Combines something the user knows (password), something they have (OTP or mobile device), or something they are (biometric verification).
    - **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: A user logs in once and gains access to multiple services without re-entering credentials.

- **Example**: When you log into your email account, you enter your username and password. The system checks your credentials (authentication) to verify that you are the correct user.

### **Authorization**
- **Definition**: Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do within a system. It answers the question "What can you do?" or "What resources do you have access to?"
- **Goal**: To define and enforce access controls, ensuring that authenticated users can only access resources and perform actions for which they have permissions.
- **How it works**:
  - Once a user has been authenticated, the system checks what actions they are allowed to perform. This is based on their roles, groups, or specific permissions set in the system.
  - **Common authorization models** include:
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access is granted based on the roles assigned to a user (e.g., admin, manager, user).
    - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Access is granted based on attributes (e.g., user department, time of access).
    - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Specific permissions are set for resources, defining who can access them and what actions they can perform (e.g., read, write, delete).

- **Example**: After logging into your email, authorization determines if you can send emails, access specific folders, or modify settings based on your permissions.

### **Key Differences Between Authentication and Authorization**

| **Aspect**         | **Authentication**                           | **Authorization**                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Verifies the identity of the user            | Determines what actions the authenticated user can perform |
| **Question Answered** | "Who are you?"                               | "What are you allowed to do?"                |
| **Goal**           | Confirm identity                             | Grant or restrict access to resources or actions |
| **Focus**          | User identity verification                   | Permissions and access control               |
| **Examples**       | Password, fingerprint, or face recognition   | Access control lists (ACLs), role assignments |
| **When it occurs** | Before authorization (first step)            | After authentication (second step)           |
| **Mechanisms**     | Usernames, passwords, biometrics, tokens     | Role-based permissions, ACLs, policies       |

### **Example in a Web Application:**
1. **Authentication**:
   - A user enters their username and password on a login page. The system checks if the credentials match a record in the database. If the credentials are correct, the user is authenticated and granted access.
   
2. **Authorization**:
   - After authentication, the system checks the user's role (e.g., "admin", "user", "guest"). If the user is an admin, they may be allowed to access the admin panel, while a regular user may only have access to their profile page.

### **In Summary**:
- **Authentication** is about verifying who you are.
- **Authorization** is about what you are allowed to do after your identity is confirmed.

Both authentication and authorization are crucial for securing systems and applications.
