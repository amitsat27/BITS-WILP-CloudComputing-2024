### **Jenkins Pipeline Using Docker Image**

A Jenkins pipeline can be configured to use Docker images in various stages for building, testing, and deploying applications. Using Docker images in Jenkins allows you to run your pipeline steps in isolated environments, ensuring consistency across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

This example will walk you through a Jenkins pipeline that utilizes Docker images at various stages. It will:

1. Build a Docker image for an application.
2. Run tests inside the Docker container.
3. Push the Docker image to a registry (like Docker Hub).
4. Deploy the application to a server (this example uses a Docker container deployment).

### **Jenkinsfile Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        // Define environment variables
        DOCKER_IMAGE = "my-web-app"  // Name of your Docker image
        DOCKER_TAG = "latest"        // Tag for the image
        REGISTRY = "dockerhub"       // Your Docker registry
        DOCKER_USERNAME = credentials('docker-username')  // Jenkins credentials for Docker
        DOCKER_PASSWORD = credentials('docker-password')  // Jenkins credentials for Docker
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the latest code from the Git repository
                git 'https://github.com/username/my-web-app.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile
                    sh '''
                    docker build -t $DOCKER_IMAGE:$DOCKER_TAG .
                    '''
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run tests inside the Docker container
                    sh '''
                    docker run --rm $DOCKER_IMAGE:$DOCKER_TAG npm test
                    '''
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Push Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Log in to Docker registry and push the Docker image
                    sh '''
                    docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD
                    docker tag $DOCKER_IMAGE:$DOCKER_TAG $REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE:$DOCKER_TAG
                    docker push $REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE:$DOCKER_TAG
                    '''
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Server') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Deploy the Docker image to a server (e.g., using Docker run command)
                    sh '''
                    docker pull $REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE:$DOCKER_TAG
                    docker stop my-web-app || true
                    docker rm my-web-app || true
                    docker run -d --name my-web-app -p 8080:8080 $REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE:$DOCKER_TAG
                    '''
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Clean Up') {
            steps {
                // Clean up any unused Docker images after deployment
                script {
                    sh 'docker rmi $REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE:$DOCKER_TAG'
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            // This block runs after all stages, regardless of success or failure
            echo 'Pipeline completed'
        }
        success {
            // This block runs if the pipeline succeeds
            echo 'Deployment successful!'
        }
        failure {
            // This block runs if the pipeline fails
            echo 'Pipeline failed!'
        }
    }
}
```

### **Explanation of the Jenkinsfile Stages**

1. **Checkout Code**:
   - This stage checks out the latest code from your Git repository using the `git` command. Replace `'https://github.com/username/my-web-app.git'` with the actual URL of your repository.

2. **Build Docker Image**:
   - In this stage, Jenkins uses the `docker build` command to build a Docker image based on the `Dockerfile` located in the project directory.
   - The image is tagged with the name defined in the `DOCKER_IMAGE` environment variable and the tag `latest`.

3. **Run Tests**:
   - In this stage, Jenkins runs tests using `npm test` inside the Docker container.
   - The `docker run --rm` command runs the container, executes the tests, and removes the container after the test run.

4. **Push Docker Image**:
   - This stage logs into Docker Hub (or another Docker registry) using Jenkins credentials (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`).
   - The image is tagged with `$REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE:$DOCKER_TAG` and pushed to the Docker registry.

5. **Deploy to Server**:
   - In this stage, Jenkins pulls the Docker image from the Docker registry and deploys it to a server. 
   - If a container with the name `my-web-app` already exists, it stops and removes the old container using `docker stop` and `docker rm`.
   - Then, it runs the new container in detached mode (`-d`) and maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 inside the container.

6. **Clean Up**:
   - This stage cleans up unused Docker images to save space. It removes the image using `docker rmi`.

### **Setup Jenkins for Docker Pipeline**

1. **Install Docker on Jenkins Agent**:
   - Ensure that Docker is installed on the Jenkins agent where this pipeline will run. This is necessary for building and running Docker images.

2. **Docker Hub Credentials in Jenkins**:
   - Go to Jenkins' **Manage Jenkins** → **Manage Credentials** → **Global credentials** and add your Docker Hub credentials (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`).

3. **Install Docker Plugin in Jenkins**:
   - Make sure you have the **Docker Plugin** installed in Jenkins to interact with Docker directly from Jenkins.

4. **Dockerfile in Your Repository**:
   - Your repository should contain a valid `Dockerfile` to build the Docker image. Here’s an example of a simple Dockerfile for a Node.js app:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the official Node.js image from Docker Hub
   FROM node:14

   # Set the working directory inside the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy package.json and install dependencies
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install

   # Copy the rest of the application code
   COPY . .

   # Expose the port the app will run on
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Command to run the application
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

5. **Run the Jenkins Pipeline**:
   - Once the Jenkinsfile is ready and configured, trigger the pipeline by clicking on **Build Now**.
   - Monitor the logs to ensure each stage runs successfully (building the Docker image, running tests, pushing the image, and deploying the app).

---

### **Additional Notes:**

- **Docker Registry**: You can use other registries like AWS ECR, Google Container Registry, or a private registry instead of Docker Hub by changing the `$REGISTRY` variable and using the appropriate login credentials.
- **Error Handling**: The example does not include detailed error handling, but you can add `try-catch` blocks or use `post` sections to handle specific actions if a stage fails.
- **Deployment to Kubernetes**: If you are deploying to a Kubernetes cluster, you can modify the deployment section to use `kubectl` commands to apply Kubernetes manifests or roll out a new deployment.

This pipeline allows you to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying a Dockerized application using Jenkins, making it easier to maintain consistent environments across your build and production systems.
