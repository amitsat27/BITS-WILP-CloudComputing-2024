Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Below is a list of commonly used Docker commands with examples to help you get started with container management.

---

### 1. **Docker Version**
Shows the Docker version installed on the system.
```bash
docker version
```
**Output**: Displays the client and server version of Docker.

---

### 2. **Docker Info**
Shows detailed system-wide information about Docker, including the number of containers, images, storage driver, etc.
```bash
docker info
```
**Output**: Displays detailed information about Docker's environment.

---

### 3. **Docker Pull**
Pulls an image from Docker Hub or another container registry.
```bash
docker pull nginx
```
**Output**: Downloads the official `nginx` image from Docker Hub.

---

### 4. **Docker Images**
Lists all Docker images stored locally on your system.
```bash
docker images
```
**Output**: Displays a table with repository names, tags, image IDs, and sizes of images.

---

### 5. **Docker Run**
Runs a Docker container from an image.
```bash
docker run nginx
```
**Explanation**: This will run the `nginx` container interactively. If the image isn't available locally, Docker pulls it from the registry.

#### Running with Port Mapping and Detached Mode:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```
**Explanation**: Runs `nginx` in detached mode (`-d`) and maps port `8080` of the host to port `80` of the container.

---

### 6. **Docker PS**
Lists running containers.
```bash
docker ps
```
**Output**: Shows a list of running containers with their IDs, names, status, and ports.

#### List All Containers (Running and Stopped):
```bash
docker ps -a
```

---

### 7. **Docker Stop**
Stops a running container gracefully.
```bash
docker stop container_name_or_id
```
**Example**:
```bash
docker stop nginx_container
```
**Explanation**: Stops the `nginx_container` container.

---

### 8. **Docker Kill**
Immediately kills a running container (forceful shutdown).
```bash
docker kill container_name_or_id
```
**Example**:
```bash
docker kill nginx_container
```

---

### 9. **Docker RM**
Removes a stopped container.
```bash
docker rm container_name_or_id
```
**Example**:
```bash
docker rm nginx_container
```

#### Remove All Stopped Containers:
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```
**Explanation**: Removes all stopped containers by fetching their container IDs using `docker ps -a -q`.

---

### 10. **Docker RMI**
Removes an image from the local system.
```bash
docker rmi image_name_or_id
```
**Example**:
```bash
docker rmi nginx
```
**Explanation**: Removes the `nginx` image.

#### Force Remove an Image:
```bash
docker rmi -f image_name_or_id
```

---

### 11. **Docker Exec**
Executes a command inside a running container.
```bash
docker exec -it container_name_or_id bash
```
**Example**:
```bash
docker exec -it nginx_container bash
```
**Explanation**: Opens an interactive bash shell inside the `nginx_container` container.

---

### 12. **Docker Logs**
Shows the logs of a container.
```bash
docker logs container_name_or_id
```
**Example**:
```bash
docker logs nginx_container
```
#### Follow Logs:
```bash
docker logs -f container_name_or_id
```
**Explanation**: `-f` option continuously shows logs as they are generated.

---

### 13. **Docker Build**
Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
```bash
docker build -t custom_nginx .
```
**Explanation**: Builds an image from the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it as `custom_nginx`.

---

### 14. **Docker Commit**
Creates a new image from a containerâ€™s changes.
```bash
docker commit container_name_or_id new_image_name
```
**Example**:
```bash
docker commit nginx_container custom_nginx
```

---

### 15. **Docker Push**
Pushes an image to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
```bash
docker push username/image_name
```
**Example**:
```bash
docker push myusername/custom_nginx
```
**Explanation**: Pushes the `custom_nginx` image to your Docker Hub account.

---

### 16. **Docker Inspect**
Displays detailed information about a container or image in JSON format.
```bash
docker inspect container_name_or_id
```
**Example**:
```bash
docker inspect nginx_container
```

---

### 17. **Docker Volume Create**
Creates a new Docker volume.
```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```
**Output**: Creates a volume named `my_volume`.

---

### 18. **Docker Network Create**
Creates a new Docker network.
```bash
docker network create my_network
```
**Output**: Creates a network named `my_network`.

---

### 19. **Docker Tag**
Tags an image with a specific name or version.
```bash
docker tag source_image_name target_image_name:tag
```
**Example**:
```bash
docker tag custom_nginx myusername/custom_nginx:v1
```
**Explanation**: Tags the `custom_nginx` image as `myusername/custom_nginx:v1`.

---

### 20. **Docker Save and Load**
- **Save**: Saves an image to a tar archive.
  ```bash
  docker save -o nginx.tar nginx
  ```
  **Explanation**: Saves the `nginx` image as a `nginx.tar` file.

- **Load**: Loads an image from a tar archive.
  ```bash
  docker load -i nginx.tar
  ```
  **Explanation**: Loads the image from the `nginx.tar` file.

---

### 21. **Docker Compose Up**
Starts up all services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
```bash
docker-compose up
```
#### Run in Detached Mode:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### Conclusion
These commands are essential for managing Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks effectively. Docker simplifies the process of packaging and deploying applications, making it an invaluable tool for cloud-native development and DevOps.
