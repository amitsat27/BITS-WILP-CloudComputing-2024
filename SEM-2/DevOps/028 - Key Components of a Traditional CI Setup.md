A traditional Continuous Integration (CI) setup involves several key components that work together to automate the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and preparing software for deployment. Here are the essential components of a traditional CI setup:

### 1. **Version Control System (VCS)**

- **Purpose**: Manages and tracks changes to source code.
- **Examples**: Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial.
- **Functionality**: Developers commit their code changes to the repository, which serves as the central source of truth for the project.

### 2. **CI Server**

- **Purpose**: Automates the process of building, testing, and integrating code changes.
- **Examples**: Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD.
- **Functionality**: Monitors the VCS for changes, triggers the build process upon detecting new commits, and manages the execution of various CI tasks (e.g., building the application, running tests).

### 3. **Build Automation Tool**

- **Purpose**: Compiles the source code, packages it into artifacts, and handles dependencies.
- **Examples**: Maven, Gradle, Ant, Make, npm (for JavaScript projects).
- **Functionality**: Automates the build process, ensuring that the application can be compiled and packaged consistently.

### 4. **Testing Framework**

- **Purpose**: Executes automated tests to validate code changes.
- **Examples**: JUnit, NUnit, pytest, Selenium, Mocha.
- **Functionality**: Runs unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests during the CI process, providing feedback on code quality and identifying bugs.

### 5. **Test Automation Tool**

- **Purpose**: Automates the execution of tests.
- **Examples**: Jenkins with test plugins, CircleCI, or dedicated test runners.
- **Functionality**: Ensures that tests are executed automatically after the build process and that results are reported back to developers.

### 6. **Artifact Repository**

- **Purpose**: Stores built artifacts (compiled code, libraries, binaries) for future deployment and sharing.
- **Examples**: JFrog Artifactory, Nexus Repository, AWS S3.
- **Functionality**: Provides a centralized location for managing and versioning build artifacts, making it easier to access and deploy them later.

### 7. **Notification System**

- **Purpose**: Informs developers about build statuses, test results, and integration issues.
- **Examples**: Email notifications, Slack integrations, webhooks.
- **Functionality**: Alerts developers when a build succeeds or fails, helping them respond quickly to issues.

### 8. **Deployment Automation Tool**

- **Purpose**: Automates the deployment of built artifacts to different environments (e.g., staging, production).
- **Examples**: Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Kubernetes, or custom deployment scripts.
- **Functionality**: Manages the deployment process, ensuring that the latest version of the application is deployed consistently and reliably.

### 9. **Configuration Management**

- **Purpose**: Manages configurations for different environments to ensure consistency.
- **Examples**: Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Terraform.
- **Functionality**: Ensures that the infrastructure and application configurations are versioned and managed as code.

### 10. **Monitoring and Feedback Loop**

- **Purpose**: Monitors the application in production for performance and issues.
- **Examples**: Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, ELK Stack.
- **Functionality**: Collects metrics, logs, and user feedback to provide insights into application performance and detect issues early.
