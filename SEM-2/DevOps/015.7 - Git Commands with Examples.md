Here’s a list of common Git commands with their usage and examples. These commands will help you manage your Git repositories and collaborate effectively.

---

### 1. **`git init`**
This command initializes a new Git repository in your current directory. It creates a `.git` folder to track your project's versions.

#### Example:
```bash
git init
```

---

### 2. **`git clone`**
This command is used to copy (clone) an existing Git repository from a remote server to your local machine.

#### Example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

---

### 3. **`git status`**
Displays the state of the working directory and staging area, letting you see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked.

#### Example:
```bash
git status
```

---

### 4. **`git add`**
Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area (index) so they can be included in the next commit.

#### Example:
- Add a specific file:
  ```bash
  git add filename.txt
  ```
- Add all changes:
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```

---

### 5. **`git commit`**
Commits the staged changes to the local repository. The `-m` flag allows you to include a commit message describing the changes.

#### Example:
```bash
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```

---

### 6. **`git push`**
Pushes the committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab). This typically pushes the changes to the `origin` remote and the current branch.

#### Example:
```bash
git push origin main
```

---

### 7. **`git pull`**
Fetches changes from a remote repository and immediately tries to merge them with the current branch. It’s a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`.

#### Example:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

### 8. **`git branch`**
Lists all the branches in your repository, creates new branches, or deletes branches.

#### Examples:
- List all branches:
  ```bash
  git branch
  ```
- Create a new branch:
  ```bash
  git branch new-feature
  ```
- Delete a branch:
  ```bash
  git branch -d old-feature
  ```

---

### 9. **`git checkout`**
Switches between branches or restores files to a previous state. You can also use it to create and switch to a new branch in one command.

#### Examples:
- Switch to a branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  ```
- Create and switch to a new branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b new-feature
  ```

---

### 10. **`git merge`**
Merges changes from one branch into another. Typically, you'd merge a feature branch into the `main` branch.

#### Example:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

---

### 11. **`git log`**
Shows the commit history for the current branch, allowing you to review the changes and commit messages.

#### Example:
```bash
git log
```

---

### 12. **`git diff`**
Shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area, or between commits.

#### Examples:
- See the difference between working directory and staged files:
  ```bash
  git diff
  ```
- See the difference between the last commit and current changes:
  ```bash
  git diff HEAD
  ```

---

### 13. **`git stash`**
Temporarily saves changes in your working directory without committing them, so you can work on something else and then come back to those changes later.

#### Examples:
- Stash current changes:
  ```bash
  git stash
  ```
- Apply the last stashed changes:
  ```bash
  git stash apply
  ```

---

### 14. **`git remote`**
Manages the remote connections for a repository, like adding a remote or showing the list of remotes.

#### Examples:
- Add a remote repository:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
  ```
- List remotes:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```

---

### 15. **`git fetch`**
Downloads objects and refs from a remote repository but doesn’t integrate them into your working directory (unlike `git pull`).

#### Example:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

---

### 16. **`git reset`**
Resets the state of your repository to a specific commit. This can be used to undo commits and changes.

#### Examples:
- Reset to a specific commit (keeps changes in working directory):
  ```bash
  git reset --soft <commit-hash>
  ```
- Reset and discard changes:
  ```bash
  git reset --hard <commit-hash>
  ```

---

### 17. **`git rebase`**
Moves or applies a series of commits from one branch to another, helping to maintain a clean project history.

#### Example:
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

---

### 18. **`git tag`**
Creates a tag in Git, which marks a specific point in your project’s history (like a version release).

#### Examples:
- Create a new tag:
  ```bash
  git tag v1.0.0
  ```
- Push tags to remote:
  ```bash
  git push origin --tags
  ```

---

### 19. **`git rm`**
Removes files from your working directory and stages the removal for the next commit.

#### Example:
```bash
git rm filename.txt
```

---

### 20. **`git blame`**
Shows who made changes to each line in a file and when those changes were made.

#### Example:
```bash
git blame filename.txt
```

---

### 21. **`git cherry-pick`**
Applies a specific commit from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.

#### Example:
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

---

### 22. **`git rev-parse`**
Converts a reference (like a branch or tag name) into a commit hash.

#### Example:
```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

---

### 23. **`git revert`**
Undoes a specific commit by creating a new commit that reverses the changes of the specified commit.

#### Example:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

---

### 24. **`git show`**
Displays information about a specific commit, such as the commit message, author, and changes.

#### Example:
```bash
git show <commit-hash>
```

---

### 25. **`git archive`**
Creates an archive of files from a Git repository without including the `.git` directory.

#### Example:
```bash
git archive --format=zip --output=archive.zip HEAD
```
