DevOps is a combination of **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)**, aimed at improving the collaboration between software developers and IT operations teams. It focuses on automating and streamlining the processes of building, testing, and deploying software to ensure faster, more reliable releases. The key goals of DevOps are to:

1. **Improve collaboration**: Developers and operations teams work closely, breaking down silos to ensure smoother and faster software delivery.
2. **Automation**: Automating tasks such as testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring reduces human error and speeds up processes.
3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, where automated tests run to detect issues early.
4. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Code is automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production. With Continuous Deployment, it goes directly to production if tests pass.
5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning infrastructure using code rather than manual processes, making it easier to replicate environments.

In summary, DevOps accelerates the software development lifecycle while ensuring high quality and stability in production environments.
