Metrics in Kubernetes provide insight into the performance, health, and behavior of the cluster, nodes, pods, containers, and applications. These metrics are categorized into **system metrics**, **application metrics**, and **business metrics**. Kubernetes leverages various tools and APIs for collecting and exposing these metrics.

### **Types of Metrics in Kubernetes**

#### 1. **Cluster Metrics**
   - **Purpose**: Monitor the overall health and resource usage of the cluster.
   - **Examples**:
     - Node availability.
     - Total CPU and memory utilization across the cluster.
     - Disk usage and network performance.
   - **Key Metrics**:
     - `kube_node_status_condition`: Status of nodes (e.g., ready, not ready).
     - `cluster_cpu_usage`: Aggregated CPU usage in the cluster.
     - `cluster_memory_available`: Memory available in the cluster.

---

#### 2. **Node Metrics**
   - **Purpose**: Track the performance of individual nodes.
   - **Examples**:
     - Node CPU and memory usage.
     - Disk space availability.
     - Network I/O.
   - **Key Metrics**:
     - `node_cpu_usage_seconds_total`: Total CPU usage in seconds.
     - `node_memory_available_bytes`: Available memory on the node.
     - `node_network_receive_bytes_total`: Total network received bytes.

---

#### 3. **Pod Metrics**
   - **Purpose**: Monitor the behavior of pods in terms of resource consumption and health.
   - **Examples**:
     - CPU and memory usage by pods.
     - Pod status (running, pending, failed).
     - Restart counts for pods.
   - **Key Metrics**:
     - `pod_cpu_usage_seconds_total`: CPU usage per pod.
     - `pod_memory_usage_bytes`: Memory usage per pod.
     - `kube_pod_status_phase`: Pod phases (running, pending, etc.).

---

#### 4. **Container Metrics**
   - **Purpose**: Focus on resource consumption and lifecycle of containers.
   - **Examples**:
     - Container CPU and memory usage.
     - Container restarts.
     - Readiness and liveness probe failures.
   - **Key Metrics**:
     - `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total`: CPU usage per container.
     - `container_memory_usage_bytes`: Memory usage per container.
     - `container_restarts_total`: Number of container restarts.

---

#### 5. **Application Metrics**
   - **Purpose**: Specific to the applications running within the cluster.
   - **Examples**:
     - HTTP request counts, error rates, and latencies.
     - Database query times.
     - Custom business logic metrics.
   - **Key Metrics**:
     - `http_requests_total`: Total HTTP requests handled by the application.
     - `http_request_duration_seconds`: Request latency histogram.
     - `custom_metric_{name}`: Application-specific metrics exposed via Prometheus clients.

---

#### 6. **System Metrics**
   - **Purpose**: Reflect the system-level behavior of Kubernetes components like the API server, scheduler, and etcd.
   - **Examples**:
     - API server request counts.
     - Scheduler performance (e.g., pending pods).
     - etcd database latencies.
   - **Key Metrics**:
     - `apiserver_request_total`: Total API requests.
     - `scheduler_pod_scheduling_duration_seconds`: Scheduling latency.
     - `etcd_disk_backend_commit_duration_seconds`: Time to commit data in etcd.

### **How Metrics Are Collected in Kubernetes**

1. **Metrics Server**:
   - A lightweight aggregator of resource metrics (CPU, memory) for nodes and pods.
   - Used by `kubectl top` for real-time monitoring.
   - Example Command:
     ```bash
     kubectl top nodes
     kubectl top pods
     ```

2. **Prometheus**:
   - A powerful monitoring system and time-series database.
   - Collects detailed metrics from Kubernetes objects using:
     - **Node Exporter**: Exposes node metrics.
     - **kube-state-metrics**: Provides Kubernetes object state metrics.
     - **cAdvisor**: Collects container metrics.

3. **Custom Instrumentation**:
   - Applications expose metrics using Prometheus libraries.
   - These are scraped by Prometheus and visualized using tools like Grafana.

4. **Logging**:
   - Tools like Fluentd, Loki, or the ELK stack for logs that provide additional context to metrics.

### **Common Metrics Queries in Prometheus**

1. **Cluster-Wide CPU Usage**:
   ```promql
   sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m]))
   ```

2. **Memory Usage by Pods**:
   ```promql
   sum(container_memory_usage_bytes{namespace="default"})
   ```

3. **Node Disk Space Availability**:
   ```promql
   node_filesystem_avail_bytes / node_filesystem_size_bytes * 100
   ```

4. **Application HTTP Error Rates**:
   ```promql
   sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
   ```

### **Tools for Visualizing Metrics**
- **Grafana**:
  - Highly customizable dashboards for Prometheus metrics.
  - Prebuilt Kubernetes dashboards are available.
- **Kubernetes Dashboard**:
  - Provides an overview of cluster and pod metrics.
- **Lens**:
  - A graphical tool for real-time cluster monitoring.

### **Alerts for Metrics**

**Examples of Alerting Rules**:
- **High Pod CPU Usage**:
  ```promql
  sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])) by (pod) > 0.9
  ```
- **Node Memory Pressure**:
  ```promql
  node_memory_available_bytes / node_memory_total_bytes < 0.1
  ```
- **API Server Latency**:
  ```promql
  histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 1
  ```

By using these metrics and tools effectively, Kubernetes administrators can monitor their environments and proactively address performance and stability issues.
