Gradle tasks are the fundamental units of work that Gradle performs in your Java project. Each task represents a single piece of functionality that can be executed as part of your build process. Below is an overview of common Gradle tasks for a Java project, including their purposes and how to run them.

### Common Gradle Tasks for a Java Project

1. **Build Task**
   - **Description**: Compiles the source code, runs tests, and assembles the application into a deployable artifact (like a JAR).
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     gradle build
     ```

2. **Clean Task**
   - **Description**: Deletes the build directory (usually `build/`), which contains all the compiled classes and packaged artifacts.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     gradle clean
     ```

3. **CompileJava Task**
   - **Description**: Compiles the Java source files located in the `src/main/java` directory.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     gradle compileJava
     ```

4. **Test Task**
   - **Description**: Executes the tests defined in the `src/test/java` directory using the configured testing framework (like JUnit).
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     gradle test
     ```

5. **Run Task**
   - **Description**: Runs the application. The main class to execute must be defined in the `build.gradle` file.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     gradle run
     ```

6. **Jar Task**
   - **Description**: Assembles the application into a JAR file. This task is usually invoked as part of the `build` task.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     gradle jar
     ```

7. **Install Task**
   - **Description**: Installs the built JAR (or WAR) file into the local Maven repository, making it available for other projects on your machine.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     gradle install
     ```

8. **Check Task**
   - **Description**: Runs all verification tasks, including `test` and code quality checks, if configured.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     gradle check
     ```

9. **Dependency Report Task**
   - **Description**: Generates a report that displays the project's dependencies and their versions.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     gradle dependencies
     ```

10. **Properties Task**
    - **Description**: Displays the properties of the project, including the version, group, and other configurations.
    - **Command**:
      ```bash
      gradle properties
      ```

11. **Help Task**
    - **Description**: Displays help information for Gradle tasks and usage.
    - **Command**:
      ```bash
      gradle help
      ```

12. **Assemble Task**
    - **Description**: Assembles the application without running the tests. It builds the JAR/WAR file without performing any verification tasks.
    - **Command**:
      ```bash
      gradle assemble
      ```

### Running Custom Tasks

In addition to the built-in tasks, you can define custom tasks in your `build.gradle` file. Hereâ€™s an example of a custom task:

```groovy
task hello {
    doLast {
        println 'Hello, Gradle!'
    }
}
```

- To run this custom task, use:
  ```bash
  gradle hello
  ```

### Viewing All Available Tasks

You can view a list of all available tasks in your Gradle project by running:

```bash
gradle tasks
```

This command will display a categorized list of tasks available in your project, including both built-in and custom tasks.

### Conclusion

Gradle tasks are essential for managing the build lifecycle of your Java projects. Understanding and effectively utilizing these tasks can significantly streamline your development process, allowing for automation of repetitive tasks and enhancing productivity.
