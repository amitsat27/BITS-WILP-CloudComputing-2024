**Compliance as Code** using AWS Config allows you to automate compliance checks for your AWS resources and enforce compliance standards throughout your infrastructure. AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. With AWS Config, you can continuously monitor your environment for compliance with predefined rules and take automatic corrective actions when needed.

Here's a detailed guide on how to implement **Compliance as Code** using AWS Config:

### **Key Concepts of AWS Config in Compliance as Code**

1. **AWS Config Rules**:
   AWS Config provides a set of predefined rules, but you can also create custom rules to check for compliance against specific standards. These rules define whether your AWS resources comply with specific configurations, and they continuously monitor changes in your environment.

2. **AWS Config Aggregator**:
   This helps you aggregate configuration and compliance data from multiple AWS accounts and regions into a central account for comprehensive visibility.

3. **Compliance Evaluation**:
   AWS Config rules evaluate resources in your AWS account based on their configuration and provide compliance status. Resources can be marked as compliant, non-compliant, or inapplicable based on these evaluations.

4. **Remediation**:
   AWS Config can be integrated with AWS Systems Manager to automatically take corrective actions when a non-compliant resource is detected.

### **Steps to Implement Compliance as Code Using AWS Config**

1. **Setting Up AWS Config**:
   - First, enable AWS Config in your account. AWS Config needs to be configured to record changes in resource configurations for tracking compliance.

   ```bash
   aws configservice start-configuration-recorder --configuration-recorder-name default
   ```

2. **Create AWS Config Rules**:
   AWS Config allows you to use predefined rules or create custom rules using AWS Lambda functions.

   - **Predefined Rules**:
     AWS provides several built-in rules for common compliance checks. For example:
     - **`EC2_INSTANCE_TYPE_CHECK`**: Ensures that EC2 instances use the approved instance types.
     - **`S3_BUCKET_VERSIONING_ENABLED`**: Ensures that versioning is enabled on S3 buckets.
     - **`IAM_USER_GROUPS_CHECK`**: Ensures that IAM users are part of the correct groups.

   - **Custom Rules**:
     Custom rules allow you to define specific compliance checks using **AWS Lambda** functions. You can write a Lambda function that checks for specific configurations in your AWS environment and triggers compliance violations if required.

     **Example**: Creating a custom rule to ensure that all EC2 instances have the correct tags.

     1. **Write the Lambda Function**:
        ```python
        import json
        
        def lambda_handler(event, context):
            # Extract EC2 instance details from the event
            instance_id = event['detail']['requestParameters']['instancesSet']['items'][0]['instanceId']
            tags = event['detail']['requestParameters']['tagSet']
            
            # Check if the 'Environment' tag exists and its value is 'Production'
            environment_tag = next((tag for tag in tags if tag['key'] == 'Environment'), None)
            if environment_tag and environment_tag['value'] == 'Production':
                return {
                    'compliance_type': 'COMPLIANT'
                }
            else:
                return {
                    'compliance_type': 'NON_COMPLIANT',
                    'annotation': f'EC2 instance {instance_id} does not have correct Environment tag.'
                }
        ```

     2. **Create the Config Rule**:
        After the Lambda function is created, you can create a custom AWS Config rule.

        ```bash
        aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule file://custom-rule.json
        ```

        The `custom-rule.json` file contains the configuration for the custom rule and specifies the Lambda function to evaluate resources.

3. **Monitor Compliance**:
   Once AWS Config is set up and the rules are created, AWS Config will automatically evaluate your resources based on the specified rules.

   - To view the compliance status of your resources, you can use the AWS Config Console or the AWS CLI to get the compliance status.

   ```bash
   aws configservice describe-compliance-by-config-rule --config-rule-name EC2_INSTANCE_TAGS_CHECK
   ```

   This will return the compliance status of the EC2 instance tagging check rule. You can also use AWS Config’s dashboards to visualize compliance trends over time.

4. **Automated Remediation**:
   In case of non-compliance, AWS Config can trigger remediation actions to bring resources back to a compliant state.

   - **Remediation via Systems Manager**:
     You can use AWS Systems Manager Automation runbooks to automatically remediate non-compliant resources. For example, if an S3 bucket is non-compliant because versioning is disabled, you can automatically enable versioning using Systems Manager.

     ```bash
     aws configservice put-remediation-configurations --remediation-configurations file://remediation-config.json
     ```

     The `remediation-config.json` file specifies the remediation action, such as enabling S3 versioning or applying security patches.

### **Example: Implementing a Compliance Check for S3 Bucket Versioning**

Let’s consider an example where your organization’s compliance requirement is to ensure that all S3 buckets have versioning enabled.

#### 1. **Predefined AWS Config Rule:**

AWS provides a built-in rule called `S3_BUCKET_VERSIONING_ENABLED`, which ensures that versioning is enabled on S3 buckets.

```bash
aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule file://s3-versioning-rule.json
```

The `s3-versioning-rule.json` would look something like this:

```json
{
  "ConfigRuleName": "s3-versioning-rule",
  "Source": {
    "Owner": "AWS",
    "SourceIdentifier": "S3_BUCKET_VERSIONING_ENABLED"
  },
  "Scope": {
    "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
      "AWS::S3::Bucket"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 2. **Monitor Compliance**:

You can monitor whether all S3 buckets are compliant by checking the compliance status using the AWS CLI or AWS Config Console:

```bash
aws configservice describe-compliance-by-config-rule --config-rule-name s3-versioning-rule
```

#### 3. **Remediation (If Versioning Is Disabled)**:

If an S3 bucket does not have versioning enabled, you can automatically remediate it by using AWS Systems Manager Automation.

Create a **runbook** to enable versioning for an S3 bucket, and associate it with the AWS Config rule. Here's an example remediation action in the `remediation-config.json` file:

```json
{
  "ConfigRuleName": "s3-versioning-rule",
  "TargetType": "SSM_DOCUMENT",
  "TargetId": "AWS-EnableS3BucketVersioning",
  "Parameters": {
    "BucketName": "your-bucket-name"
  },
  "MaximumAutomaticAttempts": 3,
  "RetryIntervalSeconds": 60
}
```

This will automatically enable versioning for non-compliant S3 buckets.

### **Benefits of Compliance as Code Using AWS Config**

1. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - AWS Config allows you to continuously monitor your resources, ensuring that your infrastructure is always in compliance with the required standards.

2. **Automated Remediation**:
   - AWS Config integrates with Systems Manager to automatically take corrective actions, reducing the need for manual intervention.

3. **Auditable and Traceable**:
   - All compliance checks and changes are stored in AWS Config logs, making it easier to track and audit compliance over time.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Compliance as Code scales with your infrastructure, ensuring that compliance checks are applied consistently across all regions and accounts.

### **Conclusion**

**Compliance as Code** using AWS Config is a powerful way to automate the process of ensuring that your AWS resources meet internal and regulatory compliance standards. By defining compliance rules in code and integrating them into the infrastructure lifecycle, you can achieve continuous compliance, automate remediation, and ensure security across your AWS environment. This approach aligns with modern DevOps practices, enabling you to build, deploy, and operate compliant systems with minimal manual effort.
