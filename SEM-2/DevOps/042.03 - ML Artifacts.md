**ML artifacts** are outputs or intermediate results produced during the machine learning lifecycle. They represent various stages of the process, from data preprocessing to model deployment, and are essential for ensuring reproducibility, transparency, and efficient collaboration in ML projects.

### **Key ML Artifacts**

#### **1. Data Artifacts**
   - Represent input and processed data used during the ML workflow.
   - **Examples**:
     - Raw datasets: Original data collected for training (e.g., CSV, JSON, SQL tables).
     - Processed datasets: Cleaned or transformed data after preprocessing.
     - Feature store: Centralized repository of features for reuse.
     - Training-validation splits: Segments of the dataset used for training and validation.
   - **Importance**: Ensure reproducibility by saving the exact version of data used for training.

---

#### **2. Model Artifacts**
   - Represent trained machine learning models or their parameters.
   - **Examples**:
     - Model weights or parameters: Numerical values learned during training (e.g., `.h5`, `.pt`, `.pkl` files).
     - Model architecture: Definition of the model structure (e.g., `.json` or `.yaml` files).
     - Serialized models: Saved models for deployment (e.g., TensorFlow SavedModel, ONNX, or PyTorch format).
   - **Importance**: Allow deployment, evaluation, and sharing of trained models.

---

#### **3. Code Artifacts**
   - Represent scripts and source code used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
   - **Examples**:
     - Preprocessing scripts: Code for cleaning or transforming data.
     - Training scripts: Define how the model is trained.
     - Custom layers or metrics: Any user-defined logic used in the training process.
   - **Importance**: Ensures transparency and reproducibility of the pipeline.

---

#### **4. Metrics Artifacts**
   - Represent evaluation results and performance measurements of models.
   - **Examples**:
     - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or AUC metrics for classification.
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared for regression.
     - Confusion matrices or ROC curves.
   - **Importance**: Provide insights into model quality and help in selecting the best model.

---

#### **5. Configuration Artifacts**
   - Represent the parameters or settings used during training and deployment.
   - **Examples**:
     - Hyperparameter configurations (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs).
     - Training environment settings (e.g., hardware type, library versions).
     - Deployment configurations (e.g., endpoint URLs, scaling parameters).
   - **Importance**: Ensure consistency across different environments or runs.

---

#### **6. Logs and Tracking Artifacts**
   - Represent the records of various events and outputs during training or inference.
   - **Examples**:
     - Training logs: Loss values, epochs, and duration.
     - System logs: Hardware utilization, errors, or crashes.
     - Experiment tracking logs: Metadata captured by tools like MLflow or TensorBoard.
   - **Importance**: Facilitate debugging and audit trails.

---

#### **7. Validation and Test Artifacts**
   - Represent outputs from evaluating models on validation or test datasets.
   - **Examples**:
     - Predicted vs. actual values.
     - Confusion matrices.
     - Validation loss curves.
   - **Importance**: Validate the generalization of the model to unseen data.

---

#### **8. Deployment Artifacts**
   - Represent components required to serve the model in production.
   - **Examples**:
     - Containerized models: Docker images for scalable deployment.
     - APIs or endpoints: REST or gRPC services exposing the model.
     - Monitoring dashboards: Tools tracking model performance and health.
   - **Importance**: Enable integration into applications and real-time usage.

---

### **Artifacts Lifecycle**
   - **Creation**: Artifacts are generated during data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, or deployment.
   - **Versioning**: Tools like DVC or MLflow can help manage versions of artifacts.
   - **Storage**: Artifacts are stored in centralized repositories or artifact stores (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure Blob Storage).
   - **Reuse**: Artifacts like features, models, or configurations are reused for efficiency and consistency.

     - DVC (Data Version Control)
     - Delta Lake
   - **Model Tracking**:
     - MLflow
     - Weights & Biases
