Maven is a widely-used build automation tool for Java projects. It provides a variety of commands to manage project builds, dependencies, and lifecycle phases. Below is a list of common Maven commands along with their descriptions and usage examples.

### Common Maven Commands

1. **Creating a New Project**
   ```bash
   mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
   ```
   - This command creates a new Maven project using the Quickstart archetype.

2. **Compiling the Project**
   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```
   - Compiles the source code of the project located in the `src/main/java` directory.

3. **Running Tests**
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```
   - Executes the unit tests defined in the project. Test classes must follow the naming convention (`*Test.java`).

4. **Packaging the Application**
   ```bash
   mvn package
   ```
   - Packages the compiled code into a JAR or WAR file, depending on the packaging type defined in the `pom.xml`.

5. **Installing the JAR/WAR in the Local Repository**
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```
   - Installs the built artifact (JAR/WAR) into the local Maven repository (usually located in `~/.m2/repository`). This makes the artifact available for other projects on the same machine.

6. **Cleaning Up Target Directory**
   ```bash
   mvn clean
   ```
   - Deletes the `target` directory where compiled code, JAR/WAR files, and other build artifacts are stored. This is useful for starting fresh.

7. **Running the Application**
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.MyApp"
   ```
   - Runs the main class specified in the command. You need to have the `exec-maven-plugin` configured in your `pom.xml`.

8. **Generating Project Site Documentation**
   ```bash
   mvn site
   ```
   - Generates a project site documentation based on the contents of the `pom.xml` and other project files.

9. **Validating the Project**
   ```bash
   mvn validate
   ```
   - Validates the project structure and checks for any missing information before the build process starts.

10. **Updating Dependencies**
    ```bash
    mvn dependency:resolve
    ```
    - Resolves and downloads all project dependencies specified in the `pom.xml`.

11. **Checking Dependency Tree**
    ```bash
    mvn dependency:tree
    ```
    - Displays the project's dependency hierarchy, which helps in understanding dependencies and transitive dependencies.

12. **Running Integration Tests**
    ```bash
    mvn verify
    ```
    - Runs integration tests and checks that they pass before the package is considered valid.

13. **Executing a Specific Goal**
    ```bash
    mvn <goal>
    ```
    - You can replace `<goal>` with any specific goal (like `compile`, `test`, `package`, etc.) to execute just that part of the build lifecycle.

### Advanced Commands

1. **Running a Specific Profile**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install -PmyProfile
   ```
   - Activates the specified profile (e.g., `myProfile`) during the build process.

2. **Building with Offline Mode**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install -o
   ```
   - Runs Maven in offline mode, which means it wonâ€™t try to access the internet to download dependencies.

3. **Setting a Specific Maven Home**
   ```bash
   mvn -Dmaven.home=/path/to/maven clean install
   ```
   - Sets a specific Maven installation to use for the command.

4. **Specifying a Custom Settings File**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install -s /path/to/custom/settings.xml
   ```
   - Uses a custom `settings.xml` file for the build, allowing you to define different repositories, profiles, and other settings.

5. **Skipping Tests**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install -DskipTests
   ```
   - Skips the execution of tests during the build process.

### Conclusion

Maven commands provide powerful tools for managing Java project builds, dependencies, and lifecycle phases. By using these commands effectively, you can streamline your development process and maintain a structured approach to project management. For further exploration, you can refer to the [Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html) for more in-depth details and advanced usage scenarios.
