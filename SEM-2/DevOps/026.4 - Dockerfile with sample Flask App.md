Creating a Dockerfile for a sample Flask application involves several steps. Below is an example of how to set up a simple Flask app and the corresponding Dockerfile to containerize it.

### Sample Flask Application

1. **Create the Flask Application**:
   First, create a directory for your project and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir flask_app
   cd flask_app
   ```

2. **Create the Flask Application Code**:
   Create a file named `app.py` with the following content:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def hello_world():
       return 'Hello, World!'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

3. **Create a Requirements File**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file to specify the dependencies:

   ```plaintext
   Flask==2.2.3
   ```

### Dockerfile

Next, create a Dockerfile in the same directory (`flask_app`) with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the entire application code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port that the Flask app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Building and Running the Docker Container

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   Open your terminal in the `flask_app` directory and run the following command to build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t flask-app .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   After the image is built successfully, run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
   ```

   This command maps port `5000` on your local machine to port `5000` in the container.

### Accessing the Flask Application

Once the container is running, you can access the Flask application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed.

### Summary

In this guide, you created a simple Flask application, wrote a Dockerfile to containerize it, built the Docker image, and ran the container. This approach allows you to deploy your Flask app consistently across different environments. You can further enhance the application and Dockerfile by adding more features, optimizing the image size, or integrating with a database as needed.
