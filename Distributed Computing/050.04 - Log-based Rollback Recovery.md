### **Log-based Rollback Recovery in Distributed Systems**

Log-based rollback recovery utilizes both **deterministic** and **nondeterministic events** in a system's computation to provide fault tolerance and enable recovery after a failure. This recovery technique relies on the concept that the execution of a process can be seen as a sequence of **deterministic state intervals**, where each interval begins with the occurrence of a **nondeterministic event**.

#### **Deterministic and Nondeterministic Events**

1. **Deterministic Events**:
   - These events have predictable outcomes. Given the same initial conditions, a deterministic event will always lead to the same result.
   - Examples include basic computational operations or internal state transitions that do not depend on external inputs or interactions.

2. **Nondeterministic Events**:
   - These events are influenced by external factors and can have varying outcomes even under the same initial conditions.
   - A **nondeterministic event** could involve the receipt of a message from another process or an internal event that depends on factors like user input, network conditions, or I/O operations. 
   - A **message send event**, however, is not considered a nondeterministic event, as it does not involve a change in system state or execution flow that needs to be recovered after failure.

### **Recovery Process Using Log-based Rollback**

Log-based rollback recovery works by identifying and logging the **determinants** (or factors) of nondeterministic events, which can affect the system state. This ensures that in the event of a failure, the process can be restored accurately to the state it was in before the failure.

1. **Logging Nondeterministic Events**:
   - During normal (failure-free) operation, each process records the **determinants** of the nondeterministic events it experiences. These determinants are logged onto **stable storage**.
   - The **determinants** refer to the critical information required to reproduce the exact outcome of a nondeterministic event. For example, if the event involves receiving a message, the determinant would include the message content and the sender's identity.

2. **Checkpointing**:
   - In addition to logging the determinants of nondeterministic events, each process periodically takes **checkpoints** of its state. Checkpoints help reduce the extent of rollback required during recovery by providing a known consistent state to restore from.
   - These checkpoints, combined with the logs, enable efficient recovery by allowing the system to start from a recent consistent state and replay the nondeterministic events from that point.

3. **Recovery After Failure**:
   - When a failure occurs, the affected processes recover by using the **checkpoints** and the **logged determinants**.
   - The recovery procedure involves restoring the process to its last checkpoint and then **replaying the corresponding nondeterministic events** as they occurred before the failure, based on the logged determinants. Since these events are nondeterministic, the replay ensures that they are executed exactly as they were during the pre-failure execution.

### **Key Points of Log-based Rollback Recovery**:
- **Nondeterministic events** (such as receiving a message or internal events with external influences) are the primary focus for logging.
- **Deterministic events** do not need special handling as their results are predictable and can be automatically reproduced.
- Each process logs the **determinants** of nondeterministic events to **stable storage** to enable precise recovery.
- **Checkpoints** reduce the amount of work required to recover after a failure, as the system can start from the last consistent state and replay events from that point.
- After a failure, recovery involves restoring from the checkpoint and replaying the nondeterministic events as they happened, ensuring system consistency.

This method ensures that even in the presence of faults, a distributed system can recover effectively without losing data or consistency, as the system can replay the nondeterministic events in the same order and with the same outcomes.
