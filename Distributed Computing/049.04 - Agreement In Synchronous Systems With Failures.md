### **Agreement in Synchronous Systems with Failures**

In a **synchronous distributed system**, processes execute in a coordinated manner with known bounds on communication delays and processing times. However, achieving agreement in the presence of failures (e.g., crash or Byzantine faults) introduces complexity. Algorithms in such systems must ensure all non-faulty processes reach agreement despite failures.

---

### **Fault Tolerance in Synchronous Systems**

In a synchronous system, failures can be classified as:
1. **Crash Faults**: Processes may stop functioning but do not act maliciously.
2. **Byzantine Faults**: Processes may behave arbitrarily or maliciously.

The ability to achieve agreement depends on the **number of faulty processes** and the fault type. The system needs to tolerate \( f \) faulty processes among \( n \) total processes.

---

### **Key Properties of Agreement**

For an algorithm to achieve agreement in the presence of failures, it must satisfy the following properties:

1. **Agreement**:
   - All non-faulty processes must agree on the same value.

2. **Validity**:
   - If all non-faulty processes propose the same value, the agreed value must be that value.

3. **Termination**:
   - All non-faulty processes must reach a decision in a finite amount of time.

4. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - The algorithm must work correctly as long as the number of faulty processes does not exceed a certain threshold.

---

### **Fundamental Limits**
1. **Crash Faults**:
   - Consensus is achievable with up to \( f \) crash faults, provided \( n \geq f + 1 \) (majority voting is possible).

2. **Byzantine Faults**:
   - Consensus requires \( n \geq 3f + 1 \) to tolerate \( f \) Byzantine faults, due to the need for redundancy to counteract malicious behavior.

---

### **Approaches to Agreement**

#### 1. **Crash Faults: Synchronous Agreement**

##### **Algorithm (Synchronous Consensus)**:
1. **Broadcast**:
   - Each process broadcasts its proposed value to all other processes.
2. **Vote**:
   - Each process collects values from all processes (including itself).
   - If the majority of values are consistent, the process adopts that value.
   - Otherwise, a default value is chosen.
3. **Decision**:
   - All non-faulty processes decide based on the majority vote.

##### **Example**:
- **Processes**: \( P_1, P_2, P_3 \).
- **Proposals**: \( P_1: 1 \), \( P_2: 1 \), \( P_3: 0 \).
- If \( P_3 \) crashes:
  - \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) still agree on \( 1 \), as itâ€™s the majority.

---

#### 2. **Byzantine Faults: Synchronous Agreement**

##### **Algorithm: Byzantine Generals Algorithm**
1. **Phase 1: Proposal**:
   - Each process broadcasts its proposed value to all other processes.
2. **Phase 2: Echo**:
   - Each process collects values from others and forwards the received values.
   - A process echoes the majority value it has received.
3. **Phase 3: Decide**:
   - After a certain number of rounds (\( f + 1 \)), each process decides on a value based on the majority.

##### **Requirements**:
- At least \( n \geq 3f + 1 \) processes to tolerate \( f \) Byzantine faults.
- Ensures that conflicting or malicious proposals do not disrupt consensus.

##### **Example**:
- **Processes**: \( P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4 \).
- **Faults**: \( P_3 \) is Byzantine and sends conflicting values.
- Other processes (\( P_1, P_2, P_4 \)) use majority voting to agree on the correct value, ignoring \( P_3\)'s input.

### **Example: Byzantine Agreement with 3 Generals**

Consider 4 generals (\( G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4 \)) where \( G_3 \) is Byzantine and \( f = 1 \). Each general proposes to **Attack** or **Retreat**.

1. **Proposals**:
   - \( G_1 \): Attack.
   - \( G_2 \): Attack.
   - \( G_3 \): Sends "Attack" to \( G_1 \), "Retreat" to \( G_2 \), and "Attack" to \( G_4 \).
   - \( G_4 \): Attack.

2. **Majority Calculation**:
   - \( G_1, G_2, \) and \( G_4 \) agree to attack, ignoring \( G_3 \)'s inconsistent messages.

3. **Decision**:
   - All non-faulty generals agree on "Attack."

---

### **Key Algorithms**

1. **Dolev-Strong Algorithm**:
   - Ensures agreement with Byzantine faults in synchronous systems.
   - Uses digital signatures to verify the authenticity of messages.

2. **Byzantine Generals Algorithm**:
   - Handles Byzantine faults with \( n \geq 3f + 1 \).
   - Relies on multiple rounds of communication.

3. **Flooding Algorithms**:
   - Nodes flood the system with their values, and decisions are based on consistent majority.

---

### **Conclusion**

In synchronous systems with failures, achieving agreement depends on the type and number of faults. For **crash faults**, simple majority voting often suffices. For **Byzantine faults**, specialized algorithms like the Byzantine Generals Algorithm or Dolev-Strong are required, with strict requirements on the number of nodes to ensure correctness. Synchronous systems provide guarantees of bounded delays, which simplify algorithm design compared to asynchronous systems.
