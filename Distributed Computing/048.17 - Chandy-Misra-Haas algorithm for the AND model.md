### **Chandy-Misra-Haas Algorithm for the AND Model**

The **Chandy-Misra-Haas (CMH) algorithm** is used for detecting deadlocks in a **distributed system** based on the **AND model**. In this model, a process is waiting for multiple resources, and it can proceed only when all requested resources are available. The algorithm uses a special message called **probe**, which travels across the edges of the **Wait-For-Graph (WFG)** to detect cycles indicative of deadlock.

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Probe Message**:
   - A probe is a triplet \((i, j, k)\), where:
     - \(i\): The ID of the process initiating deadlock detection.
     - \(j\): The process that sent the probe.
     - \(k\): The process to which the probe is sent.

2. **Local Dependency**:
   - A process \(P_j\) is said to be **locally dependent** on process \(P_k\) if:
     - \(P_j\) is dependent on \(P_k\), and
     - Both processes \(P_j\) and \(P_k\) are on the same site.

3. **Global Dependency**:
   - A process \(P_j\) is globally dependent on \(P_k\) if there exists a chain of blocked processes that connect \(P_j\) to \(P_k\) across sites.

4. **Deadlock Detection**:
   - A deadlock is detected if a **probe** message initiated by \(P_i\) returns to \(P_i\).

---

### **Data Structures**

- **Boolean Array `dependenti[]`**:
  - Each process \(P_i\) maintains an array where `dependenti[j]` is:
    - `true`: If \(P_i\) knows \(P_j\) is dependent on it.
    - `false`: Otherwise.

- **Global Wait-For Graph (WFG)**:
  - Represents resource dependencies among processes across sites.

---

### **Algorithm Steps**

#### **1. Deadlock Detection at Process \(P_i\):**
- If \(P_i\) is **locally dependent on itself**, it declares a deadlock.
- Otherwise:
  - For all \(P_j\) and \(P_k\):
    - \(P_i\) is locally dependent on \(P_j\),
    - \(P_j\) is waiting on \(P_k\), and
    - \(P_j\) and \(P_k\) are on **different sites**,
  - Send a probe \((i, j, k)\) to the home site of \(P_k\).

#### **2. On Receiving a Probe \((i, j, k)\) at \(P_k\):**
- If:
  - \(P_k\) is blocked,
  - `dependentk[i]` is `false`, and
  - \(P_k\) has not replied to all requests from \(P_j\),
  - Then:
    - Set `dependentk[i] = true`.
    - If \(k = i\), declare a deadlock.
    - Otherwise:
      - For all \(P_m\) and \(P_n\):
        - \(P_k\) is locally dependent on \(P_m\),
        - \(P_m\) is waiting on \(P_n\),
        - \(P_m\) and \(P_n\) are on **different sites**,
      - Send a probe \((i, m, n)\) to the home site of \(P_n\).

---

### **Performance Analysis**

- **Message Complexity**:
  - At most \(m(n - 1)/2\) messages, where \(m\) is the number of processes and \(n\) is the number of sites.

- **Message Size**:
  - Fixed size (3 integers: \((i, j, k)\)).

- **Detection Delay**:
  - \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of sites.

### **Example 1: Simple Deadlock Scenario**

#### **Processes and Dependencies**
- \(P_1, P_2, P_3\) across 2 sites \(S_1\) and \(S_2\).
- Dependencies:
  - \(P_1\) (on \(S_1\)) waits for \(P_2\),
  - \(P_2\) (on \(S_2\)) waits for \(P_3\),
  - \(P_3\) (on \(S_1\)) waits for \(P_1\).

#### **Steps**:
1. \(P_1\) initiates deadlock detection by sending a probe \((1, 1, 2)\) to \(S_2\).
2. \(P_2\) receives the probe:
   - Sends \((1, 2, 3)\) to \(S_1\) (home of \(P_3\)).
3. \(P_3\) receives the probe:
   - Sends \((1, 3, 1)\) to \(S_1\) (home of \(P_1\)).
4. \(P_1\) receives \((1, 3, 1)\):
   - Detects deadlock as the probe has returned to the initiator.

---

### **Example 2: No Deadlock**

#### **Processes and Dependencies**
- \(P_1, P_2, P_3\) across 2 sites \(S_1\) and \(S_2\).
- Dependencies:
  - \(P_1\) (on \(S_1\)) waits for \(P_2\),
  - \(P_2\) (on \(S_2\)) waits for \(P_3\),
  - \(P_3\) (on \(S_1\)) is running.

#### **Steps**:
1. \(P_1\) initiates deadlock detection by sending a probe \((1, 1, 2)\) to \(S_2\).
2. \(P_2\) receives the probe:
   - Checks \(P_3\), which is running, so no further probes are sent.
3. The probe does not return to \(P_1\), so no deadlock is detected.

---

### **Key Insights**

- Deadlocks are detected by circulating probe messages through the global WFG.
- The algorithm efficiently detects cycles, which correspond to deadlocks.
- No unnecessary probes are sent, as they only traverse valid edges in the WFG.
