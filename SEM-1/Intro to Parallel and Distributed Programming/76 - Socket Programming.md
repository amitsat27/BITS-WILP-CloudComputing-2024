Socket programming allows processes to communicate over a network. It enables data exchange between applications on different devices, such as computers, servers, and IoT devices. Sockets work using the client-server model, where one side initiates a connection (client) and the other side listens for incoming connections (server).

Here is a basic overview of socket programming:

1. **Types of Sockets**:
   - **Stream Sockets (TCP/IP)**: Provides a reliable, connection-oriented service. Data is transmitted in a continuous stream, ensuring that all data arrives intact and in order. This is commonly used for protocols like HTTP, FTP, etc.
   - **Datagram Sockets (UDP/IP)**: Provides a connectionless service. Data is sent in discrete packets (datagrams) and may arrive out of order or be lost. This is used for protocols like DNS, DHCP, etc.

2. **Basic Steps**:

   - **Server Side**:
     1. Create a socket using `socket()` function.
     2. Bind the socket to an address using `bind()` function.
     3. Listen for incoming connections using `listen()` function.
     4. Accept incoming connections using `accept()` function.
     5. Communicate with the client using `send()` and `recv()` functions.
     6. Close the connection when done.

   - **Client Side**:
     1. Create a socket using `socket()` function.
     2. Connect to a server using `connect()` function.
     3. Communicate with the server using `send()` and `recv()` functions.
     4. Close the connection when done.

3. **Socket Addresses**:
   - Sockets are identified by an IP address and a port number. Together, they form a socket address.
   - In IPv4, an address is a 32-bit number (e.g., 192.168.1.1). In IPv6, it's a 128-bit number.
   - A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer (e.g., 80 for HTTP).

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Always check the return values of socket functions for errors.
   - Use `perror()` or `strerror()` to print error messages.

5. **Closing Sockets**:
   - Use `close()` function to release the resources associated with a socket.

6. **Example (C - TCP Server and Client)**:

   Server:
   ```c
   // Create socket
   int server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

   // Bind socket to address
   // ...

   // Listen for incoming connections
   // ...

   // Accept connection
   int client_socket = accept(server_socket, (struct sockaddr*)&client_addr, &client_addr_len);

   // Communicate with client
   // ...

   // Close sockets
   close(client_socket);
   close(server_socket);
   ```

   Client:
   ```c
   // Create socket
   int client_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

   // Connect to server
   // ...

   // Communicate with server
   // ...

   // Close socket
   close(client_socket);
   ```

Remember, error handling is crucial in socket programming to ensure robustness. Additionally, consider security measures like input validation and encryption, especially when working with networked applications.
