Napster was one of the earliest and most well-known peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing systems that revolutionized the music industry. It was developed by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker and was launched in 1999. The Napster architecture had several distinctive features:

1. **Centralized Index Server:**
   - Napster used a centralized server to maintain an index of the files available on the network. This server acted as a directory, allowing users to search for and discover music files shared by other users.

2. **Peer Discovery:**
   - Users connected to the Napster network through client software. The client communicated with the centralized server to register the files they were sharing and to discover files shared by others.

3. **Search and Download:**
   - Users could search for specific songs or artists using the Napster client software. When a user initiated a search, the client sent a request to the central server, which responded with a list of peers that had the requested files.

4. **Peer-to-Peer File Transfer:**
   - Once a list of peers sharing the desired files was obtained, the Napster client software established direct peer-to-peer connections to these users. File transfers occurred directly between the requesting user and the user sharing the file.

5. **Metadata and Song Information:**
   - Napster not only facilitated file sharing but also included metadata and information about the songs. Users could see details such as song title, artist, and file quality.

6. **User Authentication:**
   - Napster required users to create accounts and log in. User authentication was centralized, and accounts were managed by the Napster servers.

7. **Database of Shared Files:**
   - The central server maintained a database of all shared files and their locations on the network. This database was crucial for search functionality and discovering peers with specific files.

8. **Limitations:**
   - Napster faced legal challenges due to copyright infringement issues, as it facilitated the sharing of copyrighted music without authorization. In 2001, Napster was shut down as a result of legal action, and it eventually re-emerged as a legal, subscription-based service.

Napster's architecture, with its centralized index server, was a precursor to later peer-to-peer file-sharing systems. While the centralized nature of Napster made it vulnerable to legal challenges, it played a significant role in popularizing the idea of P2P file sharing and influencing the development of subsequent decentralized P2P networks.
