**Data Parallelism** and **Functional Parallelism** are two common approaches to parallel computing. They differ in how they distribute tasks among processing units. Here are examples of both:

### Data Parallelism:

**Definition**: Data parallelism involves distributing the data across multiple processing units, where each unit performs the same operation on different subsets of the data simultaneously.

**Example - Vector Addition**:

Suppose you have two vectors A and B with elements:

```
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

If you want to perform element-wise addition, data parallelism could be used. For example, if you have two processing units:

- Processor 1 computes: `[1+6, 2+7, 3+8] = [7, 9, 11]`
- Processor 2 computes: `[4+9, 5+10] = [13, 15]`

The final result is `[7, 9, 11, 13, 15]`.

### Functional Parallelism:

**Definition**: Functional parallelism involves breaking down a task into different functions or stages, and each function is performed by a different processing unit.

**Example - Image Processing**:

Consider a task of applying filters to an image, involving stages like edge detection, blur, and sharpening. In functional parallelism:

- Processor 1 handles edge detection.
- Processor 2 handles blurring.
- Processor 3 handles sharpening.

Each processor works on a different stage concurrently. Once all stages are completed, the processed image is reconstructed.

**Comparison**:

- **Data Parallelism** is well-suited for tasks where the same operation is performed on different pieces of data simultaneously, such as in mathematical operations on arrays or matrices.
  
- **Functional Parallelism** is more appropriate for tasks that can be divided into distinct stages, where each stage is performed by a separate processing unit. This is common in tasks like image processing or video rendering.

In practice, a combination of data and functional parallelism is often used to maximize the efficiency and speed of parallel computations. The choice between them depends on the nature of the task and the available hardware resources.
