A critical section is a portion of a program that accesses shared resources or variables that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple threads or processes. It's crucial to ensure that only one thread or process can execute the critical section at any given time to prevent race conditions or other synchronization issues.

To achieve mutual exclusion and protect critical sections, synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and mutexes are used. These mechanisms help control access to shared resources, ensuring that only one thread can execute the critical section at a time.

Let's consider a scenario with one bank account and three transactions:

```plaintext
Initial Balance:
Account A: $1000

Transaction 1: Transfer $100 from Account A to Account B
Transaction 2: Deposit $50 into Account A
Transaction 3: Withdraw $30 from Account A
```

Scenario 1 (Without Synchronization):

1. Transaction 1 reads the balance of Account A as $1000.
2. Transaction 2 reads the balance of Account A as $1000.
3. Transaction 3 reads the balance of Account A as $1000.
4. Transaction 1 subtracts $100 from Account A, making the balance $900.
5. Transaction 2 deposits $50 into Account A, making the balance $1050.
6. Transaction 3 withdraws $30 from Account A, making the balance $1020.

In this scenario, the total amount in Account A is $1020, which is correct.

Scenario 2 (With Synchronization):

1. Transaction 1 acquires a lock on Account A.
2. Transaction 1 reads the balance of Account A as $1000.
3. Transaction 2 attempts to acquire a lock on Account A but is blocked.
4. Transaction 1 subtracts $100 from Account A, making the balance $900.
5. Transaction 2 is still waiting to acquire the lock.
6. Transaction 3 attempts to acquire a lock on Account A but is blocked.
7. Transaction 1 releases the lock on Account A.
8. Transaction 2 acquires a lock on Account A.
9. Transaction 2 reads the balance of Account A as $900.
10. Transaction 2 deposits $50 into Account A, making the balance $950.
11. Transaction 2 releases the lock on Account A.
12. Transaction 3 attempts to acquire a lock on Account A but is blocked.
13. Transaction 3 is still waiting to acquire the lock.
14. Transaction 2 releases the lock on Account A.

In this synchronized scenario, the transactions are executed in a way that ensures the correctness of the account balance. Transactions are serialized, preventing concurrent access and potential race conditions. The total amount in Account A is $950, which is correct.
