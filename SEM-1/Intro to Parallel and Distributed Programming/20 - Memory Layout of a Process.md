The memory layout of a process in a typical operating system consists of several segments that serve different purposes. These segments include:

1. **Text Segment (Code Segment)**:
   - Contains the executable code of the program.
   - Generally marked as read-only to prevent the program from modifying its own instructions.
   - Multiple processes running the same program share this segment in memory to save space.

2. **Data Segment**:
   - Contains global and static variables that are initialized by the program.
   - It can be further divided into initialized and uninitialized data sections.

   - Initialized Data Segment:
     - Contains variables that have an initial value specified in the source code.
     - Examples include global and static variables that are explicitly assigned a value.

   - Uninitialized Data Segment (BSS - Block Started by Symbol):
     - Contains variables that are declared in the source code but have no initial value.
     - These variables are initialized to zero during program execution.

3. **Heap**:
   - Dynamically allocated memory for variables whose size is not known at compile time.
   - Managed by the programmer using memory allocation functions like `malloc()` in C.

4. **Stack**:
   - Stores local variables, function parameters, return addresses, and other function call-related information.
   - Grows and shrinks dynamically as functions are called and return.

5. **Memory Mapped Segment**:
   - Represents files mapped to memory.
   - Allows a file to be treated as an array, where the program can read or write directly to the file.

6. **Shared Memory Segment**:
   - Allows multiple processes to share a portion of memory for communication.

7. **Code for Dynamically Linked Libraries (DLLs)**:
   - On systems that use dynamic linking, the code for shared libraries is loaded into the process's memory space.

8. **Environment Variables and Command Line Arguments**:
   - Information passed to the program when it starts.

Here's a graphical representation:

Keep in mind that the specific memory layout may vary depending on the operating system and the compiler used. Additionally, modern operating systems may use memory management techniques like virtual memory, which can further complicate the actual physical memory layout.
