A **Task Dependency Graph**, also known as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, is a graphical representation of tasks or computations where nodes represent individual tasks, and directed edges represent dependencies between tasks. It is a fundamental concept in parallel and distributed computing, as it helps visualize the flow of tasks and their interdependencies. Here are key points about task dependency graphs:

1. **Nodes**:
   - Each node in the graph represents a specific task or computation that needs to be performed.

2. **Directed Edges**:
   - Directed edges between nodes indicate the dependencies between tasks. An edge from node A to node B means that task B depends on the output of task A.

3. **Acyclic Nature**:
   - Task dependency graphs must be acyclic, meaning there should be no cycles or loops in the graph. This ensures that tasks can be executed in a well-defined order.

4. **Topological Ordering**:
   - A topological ordering of the tasks in the graph is a sequence in which every task appears before any task that depends on it. This ordering is essential for determining the correct execution sequence.

5. **Source Nodes**:
   - Source nodes are nodes with no incoming edges. They represent tasks that have no dependencies on other tasks and can be executed first.

6. **Sink Nodes**:
   - Sink nodes are nodes with no outgoing edges. They represent tasks that have no tasks depending on them.

7. **Parallel Execution**:
   - Tasks that have no dependencies on each other can be executed in parallel. This means that multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously as long as there are enough resources available.

8. **Critical Path**:
   - The critical path in a task dependency graph is the longest path from a source node to a sink node. It represents the minimum time required to complete all tasks.

**Example**:

Consider a simple example of a task dependency graph for processing an image:

- Nodes: Read Image, Apply Filter 1, Apply Filter 2, Merge Filters, Save Image.
- Dependencies: 
   - Apply Filter 1 and Apply Filter 2 depend on Read Image.
   - Merge Filters depends on Apply Filter 1 and Apply Filter 2.
   - Save Image depends on Merge Filters.

In this example, the graph might look like:

```
         [Read Image]
            /       \
   [Filter 1]     [Filter 2]
       |            |
   [Merge]       [Merge]
        \          /
         [Save]
```

**Use Cases**:

- **Parallel Processing**: Task dependency graphs are used in parallel computing to determine the optimal order of task execution and identify opportunities for parallelism.

- **Workflow Management**: They are used in workflow systems to represent and manage complex processes with dependencies between different tasks.

- **Project Scheduling**: In project management, task dependency graphs help in scheduling and resource allocation for various tasks in a project.

- **Data Flow Programming**: In data flow programming, the flow of data between tasks is represented using a task dependency graph.

Task dependency graphs are a powerful tool for visualizing and managing complex processes with interdependent tasks. They provide a clear understanding of task dependencies and help in optimizing task execution for efficiency and speed.
