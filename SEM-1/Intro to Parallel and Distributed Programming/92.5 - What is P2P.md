P2P stands for "peer-to-peer," and it refers to a type of decentralized network architecture where participants in the network, called peers, communicate and share resources directly with each other, without relying on a central server or authority. In a P2P network, each peer has equal status, and they can act both as a client and a server.

Key characteristics of P2P networks include:

1. **Decentralization:** P2P networks operate without a central server or hub. Peers communicate directly with each other, enabling a more distributed and resilient system.

2. **Resource Sharing:** Participants in a P2P network share resources such as processing power, storage, or content directly with each other. This sharing can lead to more efficient use of resources.

3. **Autonomy:** Each peer in a P2P network operates independently and does not rely on a central entity to coordinate actions. This autonomy contributes to the robustness of the network.

4. **Scalability:** P2P networks can be easily scaled by adding more peers. As the number of peers increases, the overall capacity and capabilities of the network can grow.

5. **Resilience:** P2P networks are often more resilient to failures because they lack a single point of failure. If one node goes down, the network can continue to operate through other nodes.

6. **Distributed Processing:** P2P networks can be used for distributed processing tasks, where different nodes collaborate to perform a task that requires significant computational power.

7. **Content Distribution:** P2P networks are commonly used for distributing large files or content efficiently. Each peer can contribute to the distribution by sharing parts of the content with others.

8. **Examples:** Some well-known examples of P2P systems include BitTorrent for file sharing, Bitcoin for decentralized cryptocurrency transactions, and various messaging applications that use P2P communication.

P2P networks can be further classified into different architectures, such as pure P2P, hybrid P2P, structured P2P, and unstructured P2P, depending on the organization and coordination among the peers. P2P technology has been widely used in various applications and has implications for communication, file sharing, distributed computing, and more.
