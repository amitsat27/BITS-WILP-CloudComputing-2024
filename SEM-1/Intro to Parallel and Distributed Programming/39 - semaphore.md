A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to control access to a shared resource. It acts as a counter that is used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system.

A semaphore can have an integer value and supports two main operations:

1. **Wait (P) Operation:** This operation decrements the value of the semaphore. If the resulting value is non-negative, the operation succeeds, and the process continues execution. If the resulting value is negative, the process is blocked, and put into a waiting queue associated with the semaphore. This operation is also known as "down" or "acquire".

2. **Signal (V) Operation:** This operation increments the value of the semaphore. If the resulting value is zero or positive, it indicates that a process in the waiting queue can proceed. If the resulting value is negative, no process can proceed, but the value is adjusted. This operation is also known as "up" or "release".

Semaphores are used to control access to shared resources in a concurrent system and prevent race conditions. They can be used to enforce mutual exclusion or to control the number of processes that can access a resource simultaneously.

In addition to the basic semaphore operations, some systems provide additional features like named semaphores for inter-process communication.

Semaphores can be classified into two types:

1. **Binary Semaphore:** This type of semaphore can take only two integer values, typically 0 and 1. It is used for simple signaling between processes. A binary semaphore can be used as a mutex lock, where it ensures that only one process can access the critical section at a time.

2. **Counting Semaphore:** This type of semaphore can take multiple integer values. It is used to control access to a resource where multiple instances of a resource can be used simultaneously. Counting semaphores can be used to control access to a pool of resources.

Semaphores are a fundamental tool in concurrent programming and are used to implement various synchronization techniques and data structures like locks, mutexes, and conditional variables. They play a crucial role in ensuring thread safety and preventing race conditions in multi-threaded applications.
