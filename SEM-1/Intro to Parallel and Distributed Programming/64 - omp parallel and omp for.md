`#pragma omp parallel` and `#pragma omp for` are directives used in OpenMP, a parallel programming API for shared-memory systems, to parallelize loops.

Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **`#pragma omp parallel`**:
   - This directive creates a team of threads. Each thread executes a copy of the code inside the parallel region.
   - If a program already has threads created outside the parallel region, those threads will also participate in the parallel work.
   - For example:

     ```c
     #pragma omp parallel
     {
         // Code inside this block is executed in parallel by multiple threads.
     }
     ```

2. **`#pragma omp for`**:
   - This directive is used inside a parallel region to distribute the work of a loop among the available threads.
   - It specifies that the loop following it should be executed in parallel by the participating threads.
   - For example:

     ```c
     #pragma omp parallel
     {
         #pragma omp for
         for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
             // Code inside the loop is executed in parallel by multiple threads.
         }
     }
     ```

   - In this example, the loop will be divided into chunks, and each chunk will be executed by a different thread.

Combining these two directives allows you to parallelize loops, which is a common use case for parallel computing.

Keep in mind that OpenMP also provides other directives for tasks, sections, and more complex parallelization strategies, depending on the nature of your program and the tasks you want to parallelize.
