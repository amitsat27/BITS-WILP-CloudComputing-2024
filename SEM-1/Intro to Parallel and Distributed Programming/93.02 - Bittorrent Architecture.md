BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol and software application designed for the efficient distribution of large files. The BitTorrent architecture has several key features that distinguish it from other P2P systems:

1. **Tracker:**
   - BitTorrent employs a central component known as a "tracker." The tracker keeps track of which peers are downloading or seeding specific files. It helps coordinate the transfer of data among peers.

2. **Metadata and .torrent Files:**
   - To initiate a BitTorrent download, users first obtain a small file called a ".torrent" file. This file contains metadata about the files to be shared and information about the tracker. Users open the .torrent file with a BitTorrent client, which then connects to the tracker.

3. **Trackerless (DHT) Option:**
   - BitTorrent also supports a trackerless option through Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technology. DHT allows peers to discover and communicate with each other without relying on a central tracker. This enhances decentralization and resilience.

4. **Peer-to-Peer Network:**
   - BitTorrent operates as a true peer-to-peer network. Once a BitTorrent client has the .torrent file, it can connect directly to other peers in the network without relying on a central server for file transfers.

5. **Pieces and Blocks:**
   - Files in a BitTorrent download are divided into smaller pieces. Peers exchange these pieces in small blocks. This mechanism enables parallel downloading from multiple sources, improving overall download speed.

6. **Seeding and Leeching:**
   - Participants in a BitTorrent swarm can be categorized as "seeders" and "leechers." Seeders are users who have already downloaded the complete file and continue to share it with others, while leechers are users who are still downloading.

7. **Choking and Optimistic Unchoking:**
   - BitTorrent employs a strategy known as choking and optimistic unchoking to manage bandwidth efficiently. Peers are periodically "choked" (given limited bandwidth) or "unchoked" (given more bandwidth) based on their upload performance. This optimizes data flow in the network.

8. **Piece Selection Algorithm:**
   - BitTorrent clients use algorithms to determine which pieces to request from other peers. Different clients may use different algorithms, but the goal is to select pieces strategically to optimize download speed.

9. **End-Game Mode:**
   - BitTorrent introduces an "end-game mode" when a client is close to completing the download. In this mode, a client may request remaining pieces from multiple sources simultaneously to expedite the completion of the download.

10. **Piece Verification:**
    - Each piece downloaded is verified using a hash function. If a piece fails verification, the client requests that piece from a different peer.

11. **Upload and Download Ratios:**
    - BitTorrent clients often enforce a ratio system where users are encouraged to upload as much as they download. This promotes a collaborative and sharing-oriented environment.

12. **Wide Adoption and Interoperability:**
    - BitTorrent is widely adopted, and there are numerous BitTorrent clients available for various platforms. Interoperability is a key feature, allowing users to choose different clients while still participating in the same swarms.

BitTorrent's architecture and protocol have made it a highly efficient and scalable system for distributing large files across the internet. It has become one of the most popular methods for sharing and distributing files, including open-source software, media, and other content.
