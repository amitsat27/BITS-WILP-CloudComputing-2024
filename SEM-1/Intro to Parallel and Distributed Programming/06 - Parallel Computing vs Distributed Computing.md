**Parallel Computing** and **Distributed Computing** are two different approaches to solving computational tasks that involve multiple processing units. Here are the key differences between them:

**Parallel Computing**:

1. **Definition**:
   - Parallel computing involves the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes on multiple processing units (such as cores or processors) to solve a single computational problem.

2. **Communication**:
   - In parallel computing, tasks typically share a common memory space and communicate directly with one another. They work together on a shared problem.

3. **Hardware**:
   - It can be implemented on a single machine with multiple cores or on multiple machines connected through a shared memory system.

4. **Advantages**:
   - Offers high performance for tasks that can be divided into smaller, independent subtasks. Well-suited for tasks with high computation requirements and low communication overhead.

5. **Examples**:
   - Scientific simulations, numerical computations, matrix operations, and image processing are common applications of parallel computing.

**Distributed Computing**:

1. **Definition**:
   - Distributed computing involves the use of multiple computers or processing units connected through a network to work together on a task. Each processing unit has its own memory space.

2. **Communication**:
   - Tasks in distributed computing communicate by sending messages over the network. They work on different parts of a problem and then share results.

3. **Hardware**:
   - It typically requires multiple physically separate machines, each with its own memory and processing units, connected through a network.

4. **Advantages**:
   - Well-suited for tasks that can be divided into independent subtasks, and where communication overhead is acceptable. Distributed computing can handle tasks that require large-scale processing.

5. **Examples**:
   - Web services, cloud computing, distributed databases, and large-scale data processing (e.g., MapReduce) are examples of distributed computing applications.

**Comparison**:

1. **Communication Overhead**:
   - In parallel computing, communication between tasks is typically faster and involves sharing a common memory space. In distributed computing, communication is slower due to network latency.

2. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Distributed computing is more fault-tolerant as failures in one machine do not necessarily affect others. In parallel computing, a failure in one core or processor can impact the entire system.

3. **Scaling**:
   - Distributed computing can easily scale by adding more machines to the network. In parallel computing, scaling may be limited to the number of available cores or processors on a single machine.

4. **Resource Utilization**:
   - Parallel computing tends to be more efficient in terms of resource utilization within a single machine. Distributed computing involves managing resources across multiple machines.

5. **Complexity**:
   - Distributed computing often involves more complex programming and coordination due to the need for explicit message passing. Parallel computing within a shared memory space may be more straightforward.

In practice, both parallel and distributed computing are used, often in combination, to tackle complex computational problems. Choosing between them depends on the nature of the problem, the available hardware, and the specific requirements of the application.
