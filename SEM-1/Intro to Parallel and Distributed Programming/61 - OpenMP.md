OpenMP, which stands for Open Multi-Processing, is an application programming interface (API) for parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It allows developers to write programs that can take advantage of multi-core and multi-processor systems without having to explicitly manage the parallelism.

Key features of OpenMP include:

1. **Pragmas**: OpenMP uses compiler directives (pragmas) to indicate parallel regions in the code. These pragmas are special comments that are recognized by compilers that support OpenMP.

2. **Shared Memory Model**: OpenMP is designed for shared memory systems, where multiple processors have access to the same memory space. It does not support distributed memory systems.

3. **Fork-Join Model**: OpenMP follows a fork-join model of parallelism. The program starts as a single thread (the master thread), and at specified points in the code, it can fork off additional threads to execute in parallel. These threads then join back together to continue sequential execution.

4. **Parallel Constructs**: OpenMP provides several constructs to parallelize loops, sections of code, and tasks. For example, the `parallel` construct creates a team of threads, while the `for` construct parallelizes a loop.

5. **Thread Management**: OpenMP provides functions and constructs for managing threads, such as setting the number of threads, getting thread IDs, and synchronizing threads.

6. **Work-sharing Constructs**: These constructs distribute iterations of loops or sections of code among the threads in a team. Examples include `for`, `sections`, and `single`.

7. **Synchronization Constructs**: OpenMP provides constructs for synchronizing threads, such as barriers, critical sections, and atomic operations.

8. **Environment Variables**: OpenMP supports environment variables that can be used to control its behavior at runtime, such as setting the number of threads.

9. **Data Scope**: OpenMP allows you to specify the scope of variables, determining whether they are shared among threads or have private copies for each thread.

OpenMP is widely used in scientific and high-performance computing, as well as in applications where performance is critical. It provides a relatively simple and portable way to introduce parallelism into existing codebases.

Keep in mind that not all compilers support all features of the latest OpenMP specifications, so it's important to consult your compiler's documentation for compatibility and available options.
