While client-server architecture offers many advantages, it also comes with certain limitations that should be considered in specific contexts. Here are some of the limitations associated with client-server architecture:

1. **Single Point of Failure:**
   - **Description:** The server is a central point of control, and if it fails, all connected clients may lose access to services or resources.
   - **Example:** In a web application, if the web server fails, users won't be able to access the application.

2. **Scalability Challenges:**
   - **Description:** Scaling the system may pose challenges, especially if the server becomes a bottleneck as the number of clients increases.
   - **Example:** Adding more clients to a server might lead to performance degradation if the server cannot handle the increased load.

3. **Network Dependency:**
   - **Description:** Client-server systems are dependent on network communication. Network issues or failures can impact the communication between clients and servers.
   - **Example:** In a cloud-based application, disruptions in internet connectivity can prevent clients from accessing the server.

4. **Resource Intensive on Server:**
   - **Description:** The server may become resource-intensive as the number of clients grows, requiring robust hardware and resources to handle the load.
   - **Example:** A database server may experience high CPU and memory usage during peak times of data retrieval.

5. **Costs Associated with Server Maintenance:**
   - **Description:** Maintaining and upgrading the server infrastructure can be costly, especially for large-scale deployments.
   - **Example:** Regular hardware upgrades and software maintenance for a central email server in an organization.

6. **Limited Peer-to-Peer Communication:**
   - **Description:** Communication between clients is typically routed through the server, limiting direct peer-to-peer interactions.
   - **Example:** In a chat application using client-server architecture, messages are relayed through the server rather than sent directly between clients.

7. **Potential for Network Congestion:**
   - **Description:** High traffic between clients and servers may lead to network congestion, affecting overall system performance.
   - **Example:** In a video streaming service, simultaneous requests for popular content may strain the network infrastructure.

8. **Security Concerns:**
   - **Description:** Security vulnerabilities may arise due to the centralized nature of the server, making it a potential target for attacks.
   - **Example:** A centralized authentication server may be a target for malicious users attempting to gain unauthorized access.

9. **Limited Offline Functionality:**
   - **Description:** Many client-server applications require continuous network connectivity, limiting functionality when clients are offline.
   - **Example:** Cloud-based document editing tools may be inaccessible without an internet connection.

10. **Complex Configuration and Management:**
    - **Description:** Setting up and managing client-server architectures can be complex, requiring skilled administrators.
    - **Example:** Configuring and maintaining a large-scale enterprise network with multiple servers and clients.

Understanding these limitations helps in making informed decisions about the suitability of client-server architecture for specific applications and environments. In some cases, alternative architectures like peer-to-peer or hybrid models may be considered to address specific challenges.
