Concurrency and parallelism are related but distinct concepts in computing. They both involve the execution of multiple tasks, but they do so in different ways. Here are the key differences between concurrency and parallelism:

**Concurrency**:

1. **Definition**:
   - Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks or processes at the same time. These tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time intervals.

2. **Execution**:
   - In a concurrent system, tasks may be in progress at the same time, but they do not necessarily execute simultaneously. Instead, they take turns utilizing the CPU through techniques like time-sharing.

3. **Processor Utilization**:
   - Concurrency can be achieved on a single processor or core. The tasks are interleaved in such a way that they give the illusion of simultaneous execution.

4. **Concurrency Models**:
   - Thread-based concurrency and process-based concurrency are common models. Threads share the same memory space, while processes have their own memory space.

5. **Advantages**:
   - Improved responsiveness, efficient resource utilization, and better performance for tasks with high I/O or waiting times.

6. **Example**:
   - A multitasking operating system that allows a user to browse the web, listen to music, and edit documents simultaneously.

**Parallelism**:

1. **Definition**:
   - Parallelism involves the actual simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes. It requires multiple processors, processor cores, or computing resources.

2. **Execution**:
   - Parallel tasks are executed at the same time, with each task running on a separate processor or core. This results in true concurrent execution.

3. **Processor Utilization**:
   - Parallelism requires multiple processors or cores to achieve actual simultaneous execution.

4. **Parallelism Models**:
   - Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), where multiple processors share access to a common memory, is a common model. Also, distributed computing involves multiple independent machines working together.

5. **Advantages**:
   - Significantly increased computational power, faster processing of large datasets, and improved performance for tasks that can be divided into parallel subtasks.

6. **Example**:
   - Rendering a movie where different frames are processed simultaneously on separate cores.

**Summary**:

- **Concurrency** is about handling multiple tasks or processes at the same time, but not necessarily simultaneously. It is a software-level concept and can be achieved on a single processor.
  
- **Parallelism**, on the other hand, involves the actual simultaneous execution of tasks using multiple processors, processor cores, or computing resources. It is a hardware-level concept.

- **Concurrency** can be thought of as managing multiple tasks in an efficient manner, while **parallelism** is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously for performance gains.

In practice, modern systems often use a combination of both concurrency and parallelism to achieve optimal performance and responsiveness.
