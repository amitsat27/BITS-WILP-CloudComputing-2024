Process creation is a fundamental concept in operating systems that involves the creation of a new process from an existing one. This allows multiple tasks or programs to run concurrently. Here are the steps involved in process creation:

1. **Forking**:
   - The parent process (existing process) calls a system call (e.g., `fork()` in Unix-like systems) to create a new process. This system call creates an identical copy of the parent process, known as the child process.

2. **Child Process**:
   - The child process is an exact copy of the parent process, including its code, data, and resources. Both the parent and child processes start executing from the instruction immediately after the `fork()` call.

3. **Return Values**:
   - In the parent process, the `fork()` system call returns the child process's PID (Process ID). In the child process, it returns 0, indicating that it is the child process.

4. **Address Space**:
   - The child process has its own separate address space, which means it has its own copies of variables and resources. Changes made by one process do not affect the other.

5. **Parent-Child Relationship**:
   - The parent process is aware of the child's PID, which allows it to monitor and manage the child process. The child process knows its own PID and the PID of its parent.

6. **Copy-on-Write (COW)**:
   - Modern operating systems often use a technique called Copy-on-Write. This means that the physical memory pages are not duplicated during the `fork()` operation. Instead, the parent and child processes share the same physical pages until one of them tries to modify a page. At that point, the operating system creates a separate copy for the process that is trying to write to the page.

7. **Execution**:
   - Both the parent and child processes continue execution independently. They can execute different code, perform different tasks, and make independent system calls.

8. **Termination**:
   - Each process can terminate independently. When a process exits, its resources are released, and the operating system notifies the parent process (if it's still running) of the child's termination.

9. **Orphaned Processes**:
   - If a parent process terminates before its child, the child becomes an orphan and is adopted by the `init` process (PID 1 on Unix-like systems). This ensures that every process has a parent.

Process creation is a powerful mechanism for multitasking, allowing multiple tasks or programs to run concurrently on a computer system. It forms the basis for modern operating systems' ability to perform multitasking and handle multiple user applications simultaneously.
