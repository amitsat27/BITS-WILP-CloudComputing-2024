let's consider an example where two threads are trying to perform an arithmetic operation on a shared variable without proper synchronization. This can lead to race conditions and incorrect results.

Assume we have a shared variable `sharedVariable` with an initial value of 20. Two threads (`Thread 1` and `Thread 2`) want to increment this variable by 10 each.

1. `Thread 1` fetches `sharedVariable` from memory, which is initially 20.

2. `Thread 2` also fetches `sharedVariable` from memory, which is still 20.

3. `Thread 1` performs the addition `sharedVariable += 10`, making it 30 in its local register.

4. Before `Thread 1` can update `sharedVariable` in memory, the scheduler may switch to `Thread 2`.

5. `Thread 2` performs the addition `sharedVariable += 10`, also making it 30 in its local register.

6. `Thread 2` attempts to update `sharedVariable` in memory.

7. `Thread 1` now gets a chance to update `sharedVariable` in memory, overwriting the value that `Thread 2` had calculated.

As a result, `sharedVariable` ends up with a value of 30, instead of the expected 40.

This example illustrates a race condition, where the interleaving of operations from multiple threads can lead to incorrect results. Synchronization mechanisms, like locks or mutexes, are used to protect critical sections of code (in this case, the arithmetic operation) to ensure that only one thread can access it at a time, preventing race conditions.


Synchronization helps prevent race conditions and ensures that only one thread can execute the critical section (the part of the code that accesses shared resources) at any given time. This ensures that operations on shared variables are performed atomically, without interference from other threads.

In the example provided, synchronization can be achieved using a mutex (mutual exclusion) lock. Here's how it works:

1. **Thread 1** tries to enter the critical section. It attempts to acquire the lock associated with the shared variable.

2. Since it's the first thread to access the critical section, **Thread 1** successfully acquires the lock.

3. **Thread 1** fetches the value of `sharedVariable` from memory (which is 20).

4. **Thread 2** also tries to enter the critical section. However, since the lock is already held by **Thread 1**, **Thread 2** is blocked from proceeding.

5. **Thread 1** performs the addition `sharedVariable += 10`, making it 30.

6. **Thread 1** updates `sharedVariable` in memory.

7. Now, **Thread 2** gets a chance to proceed, but it's still blocked at the lock. It cannot access the critical section until the lock is released by **Thread 1**.

8. After some time, **Thread 1** releases the lock.

9. **Thread 2** acquires the lock, enters the critical section, fetches the value of `sharedVariable` (which is now 30), performs the addition, and updates `sharedVariable` in memory.

With proper synchronization using a mutex, only one thread can access the critical section at a time. This prevents interleaved operations and ensures that the arithmetic operation is performed atomically. As a result, `sharedVariable` ends up with the expected value of 40.
