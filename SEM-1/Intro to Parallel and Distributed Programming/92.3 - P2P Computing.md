Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing refers to a decentralized form of networked computing where participants in the network share resources, such as processing power, storage, or content directly with one another. In a P2P network, each participant (or peer) has equal status and can act as both a client and a server.

Key characteristics of P2P computing include:

1. **Decentralization:** P2P networks operate without a central server or authority. Each node in the network has equal status and can communicate directly with other nodes.

2. **Resource Sharing:** Participants in a P2P network share resources, such as processing power, storage, or content. This sharing of resources allows for more efficient utilization of available resources in the network.

3. **Scalability:** P2P networks can be easily scaled by adding more peers to the network. As more peers join, the overall capacity and capabilities of the network can increase.

4. **Autonomy:** Each peer in a P2P network operates autonomously and is not dependent on a central entity. This autonomy contributes to the robustness and fault tolerance of the network.

5. **Resilience:** P2P networks are often more resilient to failures because they lack a single point of failure. If one node goes down, the network can continue to operate through other nodes.

6. **Distributed Processing:** P2P networks can be used for distributed processing tasks, where different nodes collaborate to perform a task that requires significant computational power.

7. **Content Distribution:** P2P networks are commonly used for distributing large files or content efficiently. Each peer can contribute to the distribution by sharing parts of the content with others.

8. **Examples:** Some examples of P2P systems include BitTorrent for file sharing, Bitcoin for decentralized cryptocurrency transactions, and various messaging applications that use P2P communication.

It's important to note that while P2P computing offers advantages like decentralization and resource sharing, it also poses challenges related to security, trust, and coordination. Additionally, some applications of P2P technology may raise legal and ethical considerations, especially in the context of file sharing and copyright infringement.
