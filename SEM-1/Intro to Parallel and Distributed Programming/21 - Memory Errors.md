Memory errors, such as `SIGSEGV`, are common runtime errors that occur when a program tries to access memory that it doesn't have permission to access. These errors can lead to program crashes or undefined behavior. Here are some common memory errors and what they signify:

1. **SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault)**:
   - This is one of the most common memory errors. It occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location that it is not allowed to access. This could be due to trying to read from or write to a null pointer, accessing an out-of-bounds array index, or trying to execute code from a non-executable region of memory.

2. **SIGBUS (Bus Error)**:
   - This error occurs when a program tries to access memory that the hardware cannot physically address. This might happen if you're trying to access an unaligned memory location.

3. **SIGILL (Illegal Instruction)**:
   - This error is raised when a program tries to execute an illegal or undefined instruction. This could be due to corrupted code, a stack overflow, or issues with the program's binary.

4. **SIGABRT (Abort)**:
   - This error is usually raised intentionally by the program itself using the `abort()` function. It indicates that the program has encountered a critical error and needs to terminate.

5. **Memory Leaks**:
   - These occur when a program allocates memory (using `malloc()` or `new`), but fails to deallocate it (using `free()` or `delete`). This leads to a gradual consumption of memory, which can eventually cause the program to crash or slow down.

6. **Double Free**:
   - This occurs when a program attempts to free memory that has already been freed. It can corrupt the memory management data structures and lead to crashes.

7. **Use After Free**:
   - This happens when a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed. It can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes.

8. **Buffer Overflows**:
   - These occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can corrupt adjacent memory and lead to crashes or security vulnerabilities.

9. **Stack Overflows**:
   - When a program uses up all the space allocated for its stack, it can overwrite other data on the stack or even overwrite the return address, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

Dealing with memory errors requires careful programming practices, such as proper memory allocation and deallocation, bounds checking, and avoiding unsafe operations. Additionally, using debugging tools like memory analyzers and profilers can help identify and fix these issues.
