In the TCP/IP model, data is referred to by different names at each layer of the protocol stack. Here's how data is called at each layer:

1. **Application Layer**:
   - **Data Name**: Data or Message
   - **Description**: At the Application Layer, data is called "data" or "message." This is the actual information generated by the application, such as a web page, email, or file.

2. **Transport Layer**:
   - **Data Name**: Segment (for TCP), Datagram (for UDP)
   - **Description**: At the Transport Layer, data is divided into segments (for TCP) or datagrams (for UDP). These units include both the application data and control information necessary for reliable communication.

3. **Internet Layer**:
   - **Data Name**: Datagram (or Packet)
   - **Description**: At the Internet Layer, data is referred to as a "datagram" or sometimes "packet." It contains the source and destination IP addresses, as well as control information needed for routing across networks.

4. **Link Layer**:
   - **Data Name**: Frame
   - **Description**: At the Link Layer, data is further encapsulated into frames. A frame includes the necessary information for reliable delivery within a single network segment, such as source and destination MAC addresses, error-checking information, and a portion of the datagram.

It's important to note that as data moves through the layers, each layer adds its own header or trailer information to the data. This process is called encapsulation. Conversely, at the receiving end, each layer removes its respective header or trailer information in a process known as de-encapsulation. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient and reliable communication across a network.
