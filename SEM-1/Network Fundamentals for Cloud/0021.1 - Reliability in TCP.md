Reliability in TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is achieved through several mechanisms:

1. **Acknowledgment and Retransmission:**
   - When a sender transmits data, it expects an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver. If the sender doesn't receive an acknowledgment within a certain timeout period, it assumes that the data was lost or corrupted and retransmits it.
   - This ensures that data is delivered correctly, even in the presence of network errors.

2. **Sequence Numbers:**
   - TCP assigns a unique sequence number to each segment of data. When data is received, the receiver uses these sequence numbers to reassemble the segments in the correct order.

3. **Flow Control:**
   - TCP uses a sliding window mechanism to control the rate at which data is sent. The receiver advertises a window size that indicates how much more data it can receive before it needs the sender to pause.
   - This prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver with data.

4. **Congestion Control:**
   - TCP monitors the network for signs of congestion, such as packet loss or delays. When congestion is detected, TCP reduces its sending rate to alleviate pressure on the network.

5. **Timeout and Retransmission Policy:**
   - If an acknowledgment is not received within a certain time frame (known as the Round-Trip Time, or RTT), the sender assumes that the data was lost and retransmits it.

6. **Selective Acknowledgment (SACK):**
   - TCP allows the receiver to acknowledge multiple non-contiguous blocks of data, which helps in recovering from specific packet losses more efficiently.

7. **Duplicate Detection:**
   - TCP receivers can detect duplicate packets using sequence numbers. If a packet with the same sequence number is received again, it is treated as a duplicate and discarded.

8. **Checksums:**
   - TCP uses a checksum to detect errors in transmitted data. If a segment arrives with a corrupted checksum, it is discarded, and the receiver may request retransmission.

9. **Connection Establishment and Termination:**
   - TCP uses a three-way handshake for connection establishment and a four-way handshake for connection termination. This ensures that both sender and receiver are ready to transmit and receive data.

These mechanisms work together to provide a reliable data transfer service over an unreliable network. TCP's reliability features make it suitable for applications where data integrity and completeness are critical, such as web browsing, email, file transfer, and other communication protocols.
