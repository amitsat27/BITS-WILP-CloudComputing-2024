Sure! Let's go through an example of TCP communication with sequence numbers and acknowledgment numbers.

**Scenario**:

We have two devices, Device A and Device B, communicating over a TCP connection. Device A is the sender and Device B is the receiver.

- Device A's IP Address: 192.168.1.100
- Device B's IP Address: 192.168.2.200

**Initial Connection Establishment**:

1. Device A sends a SYN (Synchronize) segment to Device B to initiate the connection.

   - Source Port: 1234
   - Destination Port: 5678
   - Sequence Number (A's initial sequence number): 1000 (chosen randomly)
   - SYN Flag: Set (indicating the initiation of the connection)

   This means that Device A wants to establish a connection and starts with an initial sequence number of 1000.

2. Device B receives the SYN segment, acknowledges it, and chooses its own initial sequence number.

   - Source Port: 5678
   - Destination Port: 1234
   - Sequence Number (B's initial sequence number): 2000 (chosen randomly)
   - ACK Flag: Set (acknowledging the received SYN)
   - SYN Flag: Set (indicating the initiation of the connection from B's side)

   This means that Device B acknowledges A's SYN and also wants to establish a connection, starting with an initial sequence number of 2000.

**Acknowledging Initial Connection Establishment**:

Device A receives the SYN-ACK segment from Device B. Since this is an acknowledgment, Device A acknowledges the received SYN and also acknowledges the initiation from Device B.

- Source Port: 1234
- Destination Port: 5678
- Sequence Number (A's acknowledgment number): 1001 (A's initial sequence number + 1)
- ACK Flag: Set (acknowledging the received SYN-ACK)

This means that Device A acknowledges the received SYN-ACK and confirms the establishment of the connection. The acknowledgment number is 1001, indicating that it expects the next segment to have a sequence number of 2001.

**Regular Data Transmission**:

Now that the connection is established, data can be transmitted back and forth between Device A and Device B.

- If Device A sends data to Device B, it includes the current sequence number (e.g., 1001) in the TCP header.
- Device B acknowledges the received data by setting the ACK flag and including the next expected sequence number in the acknowledgment number (e.g., 1002).

This process continues for the duration of the connection.

Remember, the sequence numbers and acknowledgment numbers are used to ensure that data is received in the correct order and that any lost or out-of-order segments can be detected and retransmitted. They play a critical role in the reliable delivery of data over TCP.
