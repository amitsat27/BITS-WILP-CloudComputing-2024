Path-vector routing protocols are a type of routing algorithm used in computer networking to determine the best path for data to travel from a source to a destination. They differ from distance-vector and link-state protocols in that they consider not only the number of hops but also the sequence of routers through which the data will pass. Here are the key characteristics of path-vector routing protocols:

1. **Path Information**: Path-vector protocols maintain information about the entire path to a destination network, including the list of routers that the data will traverse.

2. **Policy-Based Routing**: Path-vector protocols are often used for policy-based routing, where administrators can influence routing decisions based on various criteria, such as network policies, preferences, and performance metrics.

3. **Avoidance of Routing Loops**: Unlike distance-vector protocols, path-vector protocols are less susceptible to routing loops. They achieve loop avoidance by using explicit path information.

4. **AS Path Attribute**: In the context of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the AS path attribute is a critical component of path-vector routing. It lists the sequence of autonomous systems (ASes) through which the route announcement has passed. This information helps prevent routing loops.

5. **Path Vector Table**: Routers maintain a table containing information about the paths to various destination networks. This table includes both the destination network and the associated path information.

6. **Inter-Domain Routing**: Path-vector protocols, particularly BGP, are commonly used for inter-domain routing on the internet. BGP is an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) responsible for exchanging routing information between different autonomous systems (ASes).

7. **Attributes and Policies**: Path-vector protocols incorporate attributes that allow administrators to define routing policies. These policies can influence the selection of routes based on criteria like AS path length, prefix length, and other factors.

8. **Path Selection Criteria**: When multiple paths are available to a destination, path-vector protocols use a set of criteria (known as BGP route selection criteria in the case of BGP) to determine the best path. These criteria consider factors like AS path length, origin type, and local preferences.

9. **Convergence Time**: Path-vector protocols can have longer convergence times compared to link-state protocols, especially in large networks, due to the complexity of analyzing path information.

Examples of Path-Vector Routing Protocols:

- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: BGP is the most well-known path-vector routing protocol and is widely used for inter-domain routing on the internet.

Path-vector protocols play a critical role in the global routing infrastructure of the internet, allowing for the exchange of routing information between different autonomous systems and enabling the internet to function as a connected network of networks.
