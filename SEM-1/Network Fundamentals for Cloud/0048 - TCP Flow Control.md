**TCP Flow Control** is a mechanism used to manage the amount of data a sender can transmit to a receiver in order to prevent overwhelming the receiver. It ensures that the sender doesn't inundate the receiver with data that it may not be able to handle or process in a timely manner.

Here's how TCP Flow Control works:

1. **Window Size**:
   - TCP uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data.
   - Each side of the connection advertises a "window size" in its TCP header. This indicates the amount of data it can currently receive.

2. **Receiver's Window Advertisements**:
   - The receiver advertises its window size to the sender using the Window field in the TCP header.
   - This window size is dynamically adjusted based on the receiver's available buffer space.

3. **Sender's Transmission**:
   - The sender can transmit up to the number of bytes equal to the minimum of its congestion window (determined by congestion control algorithms) and the receiver's advertised window size.

4. **Acknowledgments**:
   - When the receiver successfully receives and processes data, it sends an acknowledgment back to the sender.
   - The acknowledgment may also include an updated window size indicating the receiver's capacity for more data.

5. **Adjusting the Window Size**:
   - If the receiver's buffer space gets filled, it may reduce its advertised window size to inform the sender to slow down.
   - Conversely, if the receiver has more space available, it can increase the window size.

6. **Sliding Window**:
   - As acknowledgments are received, the sender's window slides forward, allowing it to send more data.

**Example**:

1. Device A (sender) has a large amount of data to send to Device B (receiver).
2. Device B advertises an initial window size of, say, 5000 bytes.
3. Device A sends data up to 5000 bytes to Device B.
4. Once Device B successfully processes the data, it sends an acknowledgment back to Device A along with an updated window size, say, 8000 bytes.
5. Device A now knows it can send up to 8000 bytes of data.

This process continues, with the window size dynamically adjusting based on the receiver's capacity to handle incoming data.

TCP Flow Control ensures that data is transmitted at a rate that the receiver can handle, preventing situations where the receiver is overwhelmed with data. It plays a crucial role in maintaining a balanced data transfer between sender and receiver in TCP connections.
