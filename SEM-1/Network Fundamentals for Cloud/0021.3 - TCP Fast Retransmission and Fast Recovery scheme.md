**Fast Retransmission:**

Fast retransmission is a mechanism used in TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to quickly recover from lost or delayed packets. It is based on the assumption that if an acknowledgment (ACK) for a specific packet is not received within a certain time (known as the retransmission timeout), it's likely that the packet has been lost in transit.

The process works as follows:

1. When a sender transmits a packet, it starts a timer.
2. If an ACK for the packet is not received within the timeout period, the sender assumes the packet is lost and retransmits it without waiting for a retransmission request from the receiver.
3. The receiver, upon receiving a duplicate packet, discards the duplicate and sends an immediate ACK for the original packet. This informs the sender that the original packet was received successfully.

**Fast Recovery:**

Fast recovery is an extension of fast retransmission that helps in maintaining a high sending rate when a packet is lost. It aims to reduce the adverse effects of congestion on the network.

The process works as follows:

1. When the sender receives three duplicate ACKs for a specific packet (indicating that the receiver has received out-of-order segments), it assumes that a segment has been lost.
2. The sender reduces its congestion window size (cwnd) to half of its current value to reduce the sending rate.
3. The sender then enters the "fast recovery" state, where it retransmits the missing segment and starts a timer.
4. If an ACK for the missing segment is received before the timer expires, it means that the segment has been successfully retransmitted. The sender then exits the fast recovery state and resumes normal operation.
5. If the timer expires before the ACK is received, the sender performs a "fast retransmit" and retransmits the segment.

Fast recovery helps maintain a good sending rate while avoiding unnecessary reductions in the congestion window size, which could lead to suboptimal network performance.

These mechanisms together help TCP quickly recover from packet loss, making it a reliable protocol for data transmission over potentially congested networks.
