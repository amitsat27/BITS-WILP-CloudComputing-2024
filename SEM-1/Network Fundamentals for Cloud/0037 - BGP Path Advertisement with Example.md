Certainly! Let's go through the example with specific prefixes and next-hop details.

**Scenario**:

- **AS1 (Autonomous System 1)**: Operated by Organization A.
  - **Router A1**: AS1 router with IP address 192.168.1.1.

- **AS2 (Autonomous System 2)**: Operated by Organization B.
  - **Router B1**: AS2 router with IP address 192.168.2.1.

**Configuration**:

Assuming that both routers are configured as follows:

**Router A1 Configuration**:

```plaintext
router bgp 100
 network 192.168.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0
 neighbor 192.168.2.1 remote-as 200
```

**Router B1 Configuration**:

```plaintext
router bgp 200
 network 192.168.20.0 mask 255.255.255.0
 neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 100
```

In this example, AS1 is advertising the prefix `192.168.10.0/24`, and AS2 is advertising the prefix `192.168.20.0/24`.

**BGP Session Establishment**:

Router A1 and Router B1 establish a BGP session over the IP addresses 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1.

**Route Advertisement**:

- Router A1 advertises the prefix `192.168.10.0/24` to Router B1.
- Router B1 advertises the prefix `192.168.20.0/24` to Router A1.

**BGP Update Messages**:

- Router A1 sends an update to Router B1 indicating the availability of `192.168.10.0/24` with next hop `192.168.1.1`.
- Router B1 sends an update to Router A1 indicating the availability of `192.168.20.0/24` with next hop `192.168.2.1`.

**Route Selection**:

- Router A1 and Router B1 receive the updates and use their BGP route selection algorithm to choose the best path for each prefix.

**Populating Routing Tables**:

- Router A1 adds `192.168.20.0/24` to its routing table with next hop `192.168.2.1`.
- Router B1 adds `192.168.10.0/24` to its routing table with next hop `192.168.1.1`.

**Forwarding Packets**:

- Now, if a packet destined for `192.168.20.0/24` arrives at Router A1, it will forward it to Router B1 (next hop `192.168.2.1`), and vice versa.

**Monitoring the BGP Session**:

- Administrators can monitor the BGP session using commands like `show bgp neighbors` to ensure that the session is active and routes are being exchanged.

This example illustrates the actual advertisement of specific prefixes and the determination of next-hop addresses for forwarding packets between the autonomous systems.
