The Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) framework consists of three main components:

1. **Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs)**:
   - VNFs are software-based representations of traditional network functions. These functions include tasks like routing, firewalling, load balancing, intrusion detection, and more. VNFs run on standard IT hardware and can be dynamically instantiated, configured, and scaled in response to network demands.

2. **NFV Infrastructure (NFVI)**:
   - The NFVI forms the underlying hardware and virtualization layer on which VNFs run. It includes servers, storage, and networking resources that are virtualization-enabled. This infrastructure provides the computational resources, memory, storage, and network connectivity required to host VNFs.

3. **NFV Management and Orchestration (NFV MANO)**:
   - The NFV MANO is responsible for the management, orchestration, and lifecycle control of VNFs. It comprises three main components:

   - **NFV Orchestrator (NFVO)**: This component manages the lifecycle of VNFs and their interconnections. It orchestrates the placement, instantiation, scaling, and termination of VNFs in response to network policies and demands.
   
   - **Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM)**: The VIM is responsible for managing the NFVI resources. It controls the allocation of virtualized resources to VNFs, ensuring they have the necessary CPU, memory, storage, and network connectivity.
   
   - **VNF Manager (VNFM)**: The VNFM handles the lifecycle management of individual VNFs. It interacts with the NFVO and VIM to deploy, configure, monitor, and scale VNF instances.

The interaction between these three components allows for the virtualization, management, and orchestration of network functions. This enables network operators to deploy and manage services more flexibly and efficiently compared to traditional hardware-based approaches. Additionally, NFV facilitates automation and the dynamic scaling of network resources, leading to cost savings and increased agility in network operations.
