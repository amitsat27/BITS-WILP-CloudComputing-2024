Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) is a network virtualization technology that is commonly used to address the scalability limitations of traditional VLANs (Virtual LANs). VXLAN enables the creation of virtualized Layer 2 networks over Layer 3 networks, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability in cloud and data center environments. VXLAN overlay networks consist of a data plane and a control plane, and in this response, we'll focus on the VXLAN control plane.

The VXLAN control plane is responsible for managing the creation, deletion, and maintenance of VXLAN tunnels and associated mappings between VXLAN segments and the corresponding VXLAN network identifiers (VNI). The control plane helps ensure proper communication and mapping between virtual machines (VMs) in different VXLAN segments.

Here are some key aspects of the VXLAN control plane:

1. **VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI):** VXLAN uses a 24-bit VNI to uniquely identify each VXLAN segment. The VNI is embedded in the VXLAN header and helps differentiate between different virtual networks running over the same physical infrastructure.

2. **VXLAN Tunnel Endpoints (VTEPs):** VTEPs are devices that provide the encapsulation and decapsulation of VXLAN packets. They exist at the edge of the VXLAN network and are responsible for forwarding VXLAN-encapsulated traffic between VXLAN segments.

3. **VXLAN Tunnel Establishment:** The control plane is responsible for establishing and maintaining VXLAN tunnels between VTEPs. The tunnels are used to carry VXLAN-encapsulated traffic between different VXLAN segments.

4. **Mapping between VXLAN Segments and VNIs:** The control plane maintains a mapping table that associates VXLAN segments with their corresponding VNIs. This mapping is crucial for directing traffic to the correct VXLAN segment based on the VNI.

5. **VXLAN Tunneling Protocols:** Several protocols can be used for the VXLAN control plane, including BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and MP-BGP (Multiprotocol BGP). BGP is commonly used to distribute VXLAN segment information among VTEPs.

6. **VXLAN Multicast or Unicast:** The control plane determines whether VXLAN traffic is sent using multicast or unicast for tunnel establishment and VNI information dissemination.

7. **Integration with Underlay Network:** The VXLAN control plane needs to interact with the underlying physical network to ensure proper routing and reachability between VTEPs.

By effectively managing VXLAN tunnel establishment, VNI mappings, and communication between VTEPs, the control plane plays a crucial role in enabling scalable and flexible network virtualization in modern data center and cloud environments. Different networking vendors may implement VXLAN control plane mechanisms using various protocols and approaches.
