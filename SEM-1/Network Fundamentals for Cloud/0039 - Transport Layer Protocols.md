The Transport Layer in the OSI model is responsible for end-to-end communication between devices on a network. It ensures that data is delivered reliably, in the correct order, and without errors. There are two prominent transport layer protocols:

1. **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**:

   - **Connection-Oriented**: TCP establishes a connection between sender and receiver before data transmission.
   - **Reliable**: It ensures that data is delivered without errors and in the correct order. It uses acknowledgments and retransmissions to achieve this.
   - **Flow Control**: TCP manages the rate at which data is sent to avoid overwhelming the receiver.
   - **Congestion Control**: It adjusts the rate of data transmission based on network conditions to prevent congestion.
   - **Full-Duplex Communication**: Data can be sent in both directions simultaneously.
   - **Connection Termination**: It gracefully terminates the connection after data exchange.
   - **Usage**: Typically used for applications where data integrity is crucial, such as web browsing, email, file transfer, etc.

2. **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**:

   - **Connectionless**: UDP does not establish a connection before sending data. It simply sends the data.
   - **Unreliable**: It does not guarantee delivery or order of data. No acknowledgments or retransmissions are used.
   - **No Flow Control**: UDP does not have mechanisms to manage the rate of data transmission.
   - **No Congestion Control**: It does not adjust the transmission rate based on network conditions.
   - **Simple and Lightweight**: UDP has less overhead compared to TCP, making it faster but less reliable.
   - **Broadcast and Multicast Support**: UDP can be used for broadcasting data to multiple recipients.
   - **Usage**: Suitable for applications where speed is more critical than data integrity, such as video streaming, online gaming, DNS, etc.

Choosing between TCP and UDP depends on the requirements of the application. If data integrity and reliability are crucial, TCP is preferred. If speed and efficiency are more important, UDP may be a better choice.

Additionally, there are other less commonly used transport layer protocols like SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) and DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol) that provide specific features and functionalities for specialized applications.
