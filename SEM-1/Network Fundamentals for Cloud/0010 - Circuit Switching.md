Circuit switching is a traditional method of establishing a direct communication path between two devices in a network. It is primarily used in voice-based telecommunications, such as landline phone systems. Here are the key characteristics and workings of circuit switching:

1. **Dedicated Connection**:
   - In circuit switching, a dedicated communication path is established between the sender and the receiver for the entire duration of the communication session.

2. **Resource Reservation**:
   - When a circuit is established, the network allocates resources (such as bandwidth) for the duration of the connection. These resources are exclusively reserved for that communication.

3. **Continuous Transmission**:
   - Once a circuit is set up, data is transmitted continuously without the need for address headers on each data unit. This is because the path is dedicated and fixed.

4. **Fixed Bandwidth Allocation**:
   - The bandwidth assigned to a circuit remains constant throughout the duration of the communication, even if there is no data being transmitted.

5. **Low Latency**:
   - Circuit switching offers low latency because the connection is established before any data transmission begins. This is important for real-time applications like voice calls.

6. **Inefficiency for Bursty Data**:
   - Circuit switching is less efficient for bursty data traffic because resources are allocated for the entire duration, even if there are periods of silence or inactivity.

7. **Examples**:
   - Traditional landline telephone networks use circuit switching. When you make a call, a dedicated connection is established between your phone and the recipient's phone for the duration of the call.

8. **Less Suitable for Data Networks**:
   - While circuit switching is well-suited for voice communication, it is less efficient for data networks where bursty data transmissions are common.

9. **Examples of Networks**:
   - Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) are examples of networks that rely on circuit switching.

10. **Call Setup and Teardown**:
    - Circuit switching involves a call setup phase where the connection is established, and a call teardown phase where the connection is released after the communication is complete.

In summary, circuit switching provides a dedicated, continuous communication path between two devices for the duration of a session. While it is well-suited for voice communication, it is less efficient for data networks with bursty traffic patterns. With the advent of packet switching, which is more adaptable to various types of data traffic, circuit switching has become less common for data transmission.
