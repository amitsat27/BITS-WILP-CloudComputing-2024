eBGP (External Border Gateway Protocol) and iBGP (Internal Border Gateway Protocol) are two flavors of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) used in different contexts within an autonomous system (AS).

Here are the key differences between eBGP and iBGP:

**eBGP (External BGP):**

1. **AS Boundary Protocol**:
   - eBGP is used for exchanging routing information between different autonomous systems (ASes). It operates at the boundaries of ASes.

2. **Different ASes**:
   - eBGP is used when BGP routers are in different autonomous systems. For example, when two different ISPs exchange routing information, they use eBGP.

3. **Next-Hop Address**:
   - The next-hop IP address in eBGP is typically the IP address of the directly connected eBGP peer. This means that the next-hop address changes when the route crosses an AS boundary.

4. **Loop Prevention**:
   - In eBGP, the AS-PATH attribute is used for loop prevention. Routes with the same AS in the AS-PATH are considered loops and are not accepted.

5. **TTL (Time-to-Live)**:
   - eBGP sessions between routers in different ASes usually require the TTL value to be set to at least 2 in order for BGP messages to traverse multiple hops.

**iBGP (Internal BGP):**

1. **Within the Same AS**:
   - iBGP is used for exchanging routing information between routers within the same autonomous system.

2. **Same AS Number**:
   - All routers in an iBGP session must be part of the same AS. They all have the same AS number.

3. **Next-Hop Address**:
   - Unlike eBGP, in iBGP, the next-hop address remains unchanged. This is important to maintain loop prevention within the AS.

4. **AS-PATH Attribute Handling**:
   - iBGP does not modify the AS-PATH attribute. It keeps the original AS-PATH information intact.

5. **TTL Consideration**:
   - When iBGP sessions are established, the TTL value in the IP header is not modified. This means that iBGP peers usually need to be directly connected or have a static route to each other.

**Interaction between eBGP and iBGP:**

- It's common to use a combination of eBGP and iBGP within an AS. This is known as the BGP Confederation or BGP Route Reflectors.

- BGP Route Reflectors are used to reduce the number of iBGP sessions that need to be established in large ASes.

- Route Reflectors help in propagating BGP routes within the AS, ensuring that all routers have a consistent view of the routing table.

In summary, eBGP is used for communication between different ASes, while iBGP is used for communication within the same AS. Both play crucial roles in internet routing, enabling routers to exchange routing information and ensure data reaches its destination efficiently and securely.
