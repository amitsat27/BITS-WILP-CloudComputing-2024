The Internet provides two types of transport services to its applications: **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**. Here are some characteristics of each:

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
1. **Reliable:** TCP provides a reliable transport service. It ensures that data sent from one end of the connection is received correctly at the other end by using acknowledgments, retransmissions, and error-checking mechanisms.
2. **Connection-Oriented:** TCP establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before data transfer. It uses a three-way handshake for connection setup.
3. **Ordered Delivery:** It ensures that data packets are delivered in the same order in which they were sent.
4. **Flow Control:** TCP includes mechanisms for controlling the flow of data to prevent overwhelming the receiver.
5. **Congestion Control:** TCP dynamically adjusts its transmission rate to avoid network congestion.
6. **Header Overhead:** TCP headers are larger compared to UDP, which can introduce additional overhead due to acknowledgment and sequencing information.
7. **Slower than UDP:** Due to the additional processing and reliability mechanisms, TCP is generally slower than UDP.

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
1. **Unreliable:** UDP provides an unreliable transport service. It does not guarantee that data sent will be received at the other end, and it does not use acknowledgments or retransmissions.
2. **Connectionless:** UDP does not establish a connection before data transfer. Each packet is sent independently of others.
3. **No Ordered Delivery:** UDP does not guarantee that packets will be received in the order in which they were sent.
4. **No Flow Control:** UDP does not include mechanisms for flow control, which means it can potentially overwhelm the receiver.
5. **No Congestion Control:** UDP does not adjust its transmission rate based on network conditions.
6. **Lower Header Overhead:** UDP headers are smaller compared to TCP, resulting in less overhead.
7. **Faster than TCP:** Due to its simplicity and lack of reliability mechanisms, UDP is generally faster than TCP.

Applications choose between TCP and UDP based on their specific requirements. TCP is commonly used for applications where data integrity and reliability are crucial (e.g., web browsing, email, file transfers), while UDP is chosen for real-time applications that prioritize speed and responsiveness (e.g., online gaming, video streaming, VoIP).
