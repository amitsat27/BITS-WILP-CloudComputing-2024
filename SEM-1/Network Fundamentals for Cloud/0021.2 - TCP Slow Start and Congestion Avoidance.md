**TCP Slow Start:**

TCP Slow Start is an algorithm used to control the rate at which new data is sent over a network to avoid overwhelming the network or causing congestion. It is part of the congestion control mechanism in TCP.

Here's how TCP Slow Start works:

1. When a TCP connection is established, the sender starts by sending out a small number of packets, typically one or two. This is known as the initial congestion window (cwnd).
2. For each ACK received, the sender increases the congestion window size (cwnd) by one for each round trip time (RTT). This exponential growth leads to an exponential increase in the number of packets sent.
3. The sender continues to increase the congestion window size until it reaches a threshold known as the slow start threshold (ssthresh). Once this threshold is reached, the sender transitions from the slow start phase to the congestion avoidance phase.

**Congestion Avoidance:**

After the slow start phase, TCP enters the congestion avoidance phase. The objective of this phase is to maintain a sending rate that is sustainable for the network.

Here's how Congestion Avoidance works:

1. In the congestion avoidance phase, the sender increases the congestion window size more gradually. Instead of exponential growth, it now increases the cwnd linearly.
2. For each RTT, the sender increments the cwnd by one for each RTT.
3. This linear increase helps prevent rapid growth in the number of packets sent, which could lead to network congestion.

If congestion is detected (e.g., due to packet loss or congestion signals from routers), TCP may reduce its cwnd back to a smaller value (potentially even down to 1) and re-enter the slow start phase.

These mechanisms work together to dynamically adjust the sending rate of a TCP connection based on the conditions of the network, ensuring reliable and efficient data transmission.

It's important to note that both Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance are part of TCP's congestion control mechanism and are crucial for maintaining network stability and performance.
