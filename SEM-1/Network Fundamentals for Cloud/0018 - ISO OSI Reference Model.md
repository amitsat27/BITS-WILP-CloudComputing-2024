The ISO/OSI (International Organization for Standardization/Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. It was developed to promote interoperability and standardization in computer networking. Here are the seven layers of the OSI model, listed from the highest layer (Layer 7) to the lowest layer (Layer 1):

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**:
   - **Function**: This layer provides end-user services, such as file transfer, email, and web browsing. It also facilitates communication between applications and the network.
   - **Examples**: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS.

2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**:
   - **Function**: The Presentation Layer is responsible for data translation and code formatting. It ensures that data is properly formatted for transmission and handles tasks like encryption and decryption.
   - **Examples**: SSL/TLS, ASCII, JPEG.

3. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**:
   - **Function**: The Session Layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between devices. It also handles synchronization and keeps track of dialog control.
   - **Examples**: NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC.

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**:
   - **Function**: The Transport Layer ensures end-to-end communication by handling segmentation, flow control, and error correction. It also provides reliable or unreliable delivery of data.
   - **Examples**: TCP, UDP, SCTP.

5. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**:
   - **Function**: The Network Layer deals with routing and forwarding of data packets between different networks. It provides logical addressing and determines the best path for data to travel.
   - **Examples**: IP, ICMP, OSPF.

6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**:
   - **Function**: The Data Link Layer is responsible for reliable point-to-point communication within a local network segment. It deals with the physical addressing, access control, and framing of data packets.
   - **Examples**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP.

7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**:
   - **Function**: The Physical Layer is concerned with the physical medium used for data transmission, such as cables, switches, and connectors. It defines electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects of communication.
   - **Examples**: Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, Wi-Fi transceivers.

Key Points:
- Each layer performs specific functions and communicates with its adjacent layers (above and below) using protocols and interfaces.
- Data is encapsulated as it moves down through the layers and de-encapsulated as it moves up.
- The OSI model is a conceptual framework and not a strict protocol.

The OSI model serves as a guide for understanding and designing network communication systems. It's important to note that real-world networking protocols like TCP/IP don't strictly adhere to the OSI model, but the model remains a valuable tool for teaching and understanding networking concepts.
