**Network Virtualization** is a technology that abstracts and decouples network resources from the underlying physical infrastructure. It allows multiple virtual networks to coexist on the same physical infrastructure, enabling greater flexibility, efficiency, and isolation in network operations.

Here are the key aspects of Network Virtualization:

1. **Abstraction of Network Resources**:
   - Network virtualization abstracts the physical network infrastructure, including switches, routers, and other networking devices, to create multiple virtual networks.

2. **Isolation of Virtual Networks**:
   - Virtual networks created through network virtualization are logically isolated from each other. This means that each virtual network operates as if it were a separate, dedicated network, even though it shares the same physical infrastructure.

3. **Multi-Tenancy Support**:
   - Network virtualization allows multiple tenants (such as different departments within an organization or different customers in a service provider environment) to have their own independent virtual networks on the same physical infrastructure.

4. **Overlay and Underlay Networks**:
   - Network virtualization typically involves both overlay and underlay networks. The overlay network is the virtual network that is created on top of the physical infrastructure. The underlay network provides the transport and connectivity between physical devices.

5. **Virtual Switching and Routing**:
   - Virtual switches and routers are used to handle the traffic within the virtual networks. These virtual network devices operate independently of the physical switches and routers.

6. **Resource Pooling and Sharing**:
   - Network resources, such as bandwidth, can be pooled together and dynamically allocated to virtual networks based on their specific requirements. This allows for more efficient utilization of network resources.

7. **Dynamic Configuration and Scalability**:
   - Network virtualization allows for dynamic configuration and scaling of virtual networks. New virtual networks can be created, modified, or decommissioned as needed, without requiring changes to the physical infrastructure.

8. **Security and Policy Enforcement**:
   - Virtual networks can have their own security policies, access controls, and traffic management rules. This provides granular control over traffic flows within each virtual network.

9. **Enables Cloud and Data Center Virtualization**:
   - Network virtualization is a critical component of cloud computing and data center virtualization. It allows cloud providers to offer customizable network services to their customers.

10. **Disaster Recovery and Redundancy**:
    - Network virtualization can facilitate disaster recovery by allowing virtual networks to be easily replicated or migrated to different physical locations or data centers.

Overall, network virtualization enhances the flexibility, efficiency, and security of network operations by abstracting and virtualizing the underlying physical infrastructure. It is a key enabler of modern network architectures, especially in cloud computing environments and complex data center setups.
