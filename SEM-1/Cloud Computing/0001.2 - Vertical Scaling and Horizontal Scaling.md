**Vertical Scaling** and **Horizontal Scaling** are two different approaches to increasing the capacity or performance of a system, such as a database, in cloud computing. They have distinct characteristics and are used for different purposes.

### Vertical Scaling (or Scale-Up):

- **Description**: Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single resource within a system, typically by adding more powerful hardware, such as a CPU, RAM, or disk space, to an existing server or instance.

- **Advantages**:

  - **Simplicity**: It's often easier to implement as it doesn't require distributing the workload across multiple servers.
  
  - **Preserves Data Integrity**: All data remains on a single machine, which can simplify data management and transactions.
  
  - **Predictable Performance**: With more resources on a single machine, performance improvements can be more predictable.

- **Disadvantages**:

  - **Limited Scalability**: There's a practical limit to how much you can scale vertically. Eventually, the cost and availability of higher-end hardware become prohibitive.
  
  - **Single Point of Failure**: If the single, scaled-up machine experiences a failure, it can result in downtime until it's repaired.

- **Use Cases**:

  - **Databases**: Vertical scaling is commonly used for databases where increasing CPU or memory can improve query performance.
  
  - **Legacy Systems**: Older applications or systems that aren't designed for distributed architectures can benefit from vertical scaling.

### Horizontal Scaling (or Scale-Out):

- **Description**: Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines or instances to a system, distributing the workload across them. Each machine operates independently.

- **Advantages**:

  - **High Scalability**: Horizontal scaling allows for virtually unlimited growth by adding more machines as needed.
  
  - **Fault Tolerance**: With multiple machines, there's redundancy. If one machine fails, the system can continue to operate.
  
  - **Cost-Effective**: Instead of investing in high-end hardware, you can use commodity hardware and scale horizontally, potentially reducing costs.

- **Disadvantages**:

  - **Complexity**: Designing and managing a distributed system can be more complex, especially for applications that require data consistency across nodes.
  
  - **Data Distribution**: Distributing data across multiple machines requires careful planning to ensure data integrity and availability.

- **Use Cases**:

  - **Web Applications**: Handling increased traffic by adding more web servers to a web application.
  
  - **Big Data Processing**: Systems like Hadoop or Spark are designed for horizontal scalability to process large datasets.
  
  - **Microservices Architecture**: Each microservice can run on its own instance, allowing for independent scaling.
