Here are the 7R's migration strategies provided by AWS. These strategies offer a structured framework to help organizations determine the best approach for migrating their applications and workloads to the cloud. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **Retire**:

   - **Definition**: Identify applications or components that are no longer necessary or redundant, and can be safely decommissioned.

   - **Example**: Legacy applications that are no longer in use or have been replaced by newer solutions.

2. **Retain**:

   - **Definition**: Keep existing applications or components in their current state, without making any significant changes.

   - **Example**: Certain critical systems that may not benefit from immediate migration or where compliance and regulatory requirements restrict changes.

3. **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**:

   - **Definition**: Move applications to the cloud with little to no modification. The application's architecture remains largely unchanged.

   - **Example**: Migrating a virtual machine image from an on-premises data center to a virtual machine in the cloud.

4. **Relocate (Replatform)**:

   - **Definition**: Make some modifications to the application or infrastructure to optimize it for the cloud environment, but without significant changes to the core architecture.

   - **Example**: Converting a legacy application to run on a cloud-native database service.

5. **Repurchase**:

   - **Definition**: Choose to move to a different service or platform, which may be a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution or a cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering.

   - **Example**: Transitioning from an on-premises CRM system to a cloud-based CRM SaaS like Salesforce.

6. **Replatform (Refactor)**:

   - **Definition**: Make significant changes to the application to take advantage of cloud-native features and services, but without completely redesigning it.

   - **Example**: Modernizing a monolithic application by breaking it into microservices and utilizing cloud-native databases.

7. **Refactor or Re-architect**:

   - **Definition**: Completely redesign or rebuild the application to leverage cloud-native features and take full advantage of the cloud platform.

   - **Example**: Transforming a traditional, monolithic application into a cloud-native, microservices-based architecture.

These strategies provide a range of options, allowing organizations to choose the approach that best aligns with their specific goals, constraints, and existing technologies. It's important to evaluate each application or workload individually to determine the most appropriate migration strategy.
