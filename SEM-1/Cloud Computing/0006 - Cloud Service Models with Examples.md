There are three primary cloud service models, each offering different levels of control and management over the computing resources. Here they are, along with examples:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:

   - **Description**: IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers virtual machines, storage, and networking capabilities to users, allowing them to manage and control the underlying infrastructure.
  
   - **Examples**:
     - **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Offers a wide range of IaaS services including Amazon EC2 (virtual machines), Amazon S3 (storage), and Amazon VPC (virtual private cloud).
     - **Microsoft Azure**: Provides IaaS services like Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Virtual Network.
     - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Offers IaaS services such as Compute Engine (virtual machines) and Cloud Storage.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:

   - **Description**: PaaS provides a platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. It typically includes development frameworks, databases, and other tools.
  
   - **Examples**:
     - **Google App Engine**: Allows developers to build and deploy applications without managing the infrastructure. It supports multiple programming languages and automatically handles scaling.
     - **Heroku**: A cloud platform that simplifies application deployment by providing a platform for developers to build, deploy, and scale applications.
     - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Provides a platform for deploying and managing applications without having to deal with the underlying infrastructure.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:

   - **Description**: SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access the software through a web browser without the need for installation or maintenance.
  
   - **Examples**:
     - **Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)**: Offers a suite of cloud-based productivity applications including Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive, and more.
     - **Microsoft Office 365**: Provides a collection of cloud-based productivity tools including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more.
     - **Salesforce**: A cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that offers a wide range of business applications.

These service models represent different levels of abstraction and management control over cloud resources. Depending on specific needs, organizations can choose the most appropriate service model to support their applications and workflows.
