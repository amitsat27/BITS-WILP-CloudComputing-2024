OpenNebula follows a modular and flexible architecture designed to provide efficient cloud infrastructure management. The architecture encompasses several components that work together to enable the deployment, monitoring, and management of virtualized resources. Below is an overview of the key components in the OpenNebula architecture:

### 1. **Front-End:**

- The Front-End is the central component that serves as the control plane for OpenNebula. It provides a web-based user interface (Sunstone) for administrators and users to interact with the cloud infrastructure. The Front-End is responsible for managing the OpenNebula database, handling user authentication, and processing requests from users and administrators.

### 2. **OpenNebula Core:**

- The OpenNebula Core is a set of services and daemons responsible for the core functionality of OpenNebula. It includes the following components:

    - **XML-RPC API:** Provides a programmatic interface for external tools and clients to interact with OpenNebula.

    - **AuthZ Manager:** Manages authentication and authorization, enforcing security policies and role-based access control.

    - **VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) Drivers:** Interfaces with different hypervisors (e.g., KVM, VMware, Xen) to manage the lifecycle of virtual machines.

    - **Image Manager:** Manages virtual machine images, including storage, retrieval, and cloning.

    - **Scheduler:** Optimizes resource allocation based on user policies, affinity rules, and available resources.

    - **Network Manager:** Handles the creation and management of virtual networks, including VLANs and SDN configurations.

### 3. **Hosts:**

- Hosts represent the physical machines or hypervisors in the cloud infrastructure where virtual machines are deployed. Each host runs the OpenNebula Node, which communicates with the Front-End and executes commands to manage virtual machines on the host.

### 4. **OpenNebula Nodes:**

- OpenNebula Nodes run on each host and are responsible for executing commands sent by the Front-End. They communicate with the Front-End and the hypervisor on the host to perform actions such as virtual machine deployment, monitoring, and termination.

### 5. **Storage:**

- OpenNebula supports various storage configurations, including shared storage and distributed storage. Storage repositories store virtual machine images and snapshots, and they are accessed by hosts during the deployment and execution of virtual machines.

### 6. **Network:**

- The Network component encompasses the virtual networks created and managed by OpenNebula. It includes support for VLANs, VXLANs, and SDN configurations. The Network Manager handles the creation, modification, and deletion of virtual networks.

### 7. **Sunstone:**

- Sunstone is the web-based graphical user interface for OpenNebula. It provides an intuitive interface for administrators and users to manage virtual machines, networks, and other resources. Sunstone communicates with the Front-End to execute actions and retrieve information.

### 8. **Authentication and Authorization:**

- OpenNebula includes mechanisms for authenticating users and authorizing their actions based on roles and permissions. This ensures secure access to the cloud infrastructure.

### 9. **Databases:**

- OpenNebula relies on databases to store configuration information, user data, and the status of virtual machines and hosts. The databases are managed by the Front-End and are critical for maintaining the state of the cloud infrastructure.

### Summary:

OpenNebula's architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing organizations to build and manage cloud infrastructure efficiently. The separation of components, such as the Front-End, OpenNebula Core, and Nodes, facilitates flexibility, extensibility, and ease of management. The distributed nature of OpenNebula enables the efficient allocation of resources across multiple hosts while providing a unified interface for users and administrators.
