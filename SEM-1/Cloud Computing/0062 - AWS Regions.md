Amazon Web Services (AWS) operates in multiple geographic regions worldwide. Each AWS region is a separate geographic area with multiple data centers known as Availability Zones. These regions are designed to provide low-latency access to AWS services for users in specific geographic locations.

Here are some of the key AWS regions:

1. **North America:**
   - US East (N. Virginia)
   - US East (Ohio)
   - US West (Northern California)
   - US West (Oregon)
   - Canada (Central)

2. **South America:**
   - South America (Sao Paulo)

3. **Europe:**
   - EU (Ireland)
   - EU (Frankfurt)
   - EU (London)
   - EU (Paris)
   - EU (Stockholm)

4. **Asia-Pacific:**
   - Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
   - Asia Pacific (Seoul)
   - Asia Pacific (Singapore)
   - Asia Pacific (Sydney)
   - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
   - Asia Pacific (Osaka-Local)

5. **Middle East and Africa:**
   - Middle East (Bahrain)
   - Africa (Cape Town)
   - Africa (Milan)

Each AWS region is independent, and resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets, and databases can be deployed in a specific region. Users can choose the region that best meets their performance, latency, and compliance requirements.

Within each region, there are multiple Availability Zones (AZs), which are essentially separate data centers with their own power, cooling, and networking. Deploying resources across multiple AZs in a region helps enhance fault tolerance and availability.

AWS continues to expand its global infrastructure, and it's advisable to check the official AWS website for the most up-to-date information on AWS regions and their availability. Additionally, AWS often announces new regions to meet the growing demand for cloud services in different parts of the world.
