The MTTF (Mean Time To Failure) of a system with serial components can be calculated using the formula:

$\[MTTF_{\text{system}} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{MTTF_a} + \frac{1}{MTTF_b} + \ldots + \frac{1}{MTTF_n}\right)}\]$

Where:
- $\(MTTF_{\text{system}}\)$ is the MTTF of the entire system.
- $\(MTTF_a, MTTF_b, \ldots, MTTF_n\)$ are the MTTFs of the individual components.

### Example:

Let's consider an electronic system with three serial components: Component A, Component B, and Component C. The MTTF values for each component are as follows:

- $\(MTTF_a = 10,000\)$ hours
- $\(MTTF_b = 8,000\)$ hours
- $\(MTTF_c = 12,000\)$ hours

Using the formula, we can calculate the MTTF of the entire system:

$\[MTTF_{\text{system}} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{MTTF_a} + \frac{1}{MTTF_b} + \frac{1}{MTTF_c}\right)}\]$

$\[MTTF_{\text{system}} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{10,000} + \frac{1}{8,000} + \frac{1}{12,000}\right)}\]$

$\[MTTF_{\text{system}} \approx \frac{1}{\left(0.0001 + 0.000125 + 0.0000833\right)}\]$

$\[MTTF_{\text{system}} \approx \frac{1}{0.0003083} \approx 3,248.47 \text{ hours}\]$

So, the MTTF of the entire system is approximately 3,248.47 hours. This means that, on average, the system can be expected to operate for about 3,248.47 hours before a failure occurs.

This calculation takes into account the individual MTTF values of each component and provides an estimate of the overall reliability of the system with serial components.
