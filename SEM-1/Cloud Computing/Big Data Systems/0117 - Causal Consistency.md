Let's consider a scenario with two variables, `counter` and `total`, and perform operations in a session to illustrate how causal consistency works and how it can be violated.

### Example with Causal Consistency:

```javascript
const session = client.startSession({ causalConsistency: true });

await session.withTransaction(async () => {
  // Initial values
  let counter = await collection.findOne({ _id: "counter" });
  let total = await collection.findOne({ _id: "total" });

  // Increment the counter
  await collection.updateOne({ _id: "counter" }, { $inc: { value: 1 } });
  
  // Update the total based on the incremented counter
  await collection.updateOne({ _id: "total" }, { $inc: { value: counter.value } });

  // Read the final state
  counter = await collection.findOne({ _id: "counter" });
  total = await collection.findOne({ __id: "total" });

  console.log("Counter:", counter.value); // Output: Counter: 1
  console.log("Total:", total.value);     // Output: Total: 1
});

await session.endSession();
```

In this example, the operations are causally consistent within the session. The increment of the `counter` variable is properly reflected in the update of the `total` variable.

### Example with Causal Consistency Violation:

```javascript
const sessionA = client.startSession({ causalConsistency: true });
const sessionB = client.startSession({ causalConsistency: true });

await sessionA.withTransaction(async () => {
  // Session A increments the counter
  await collection.updateOne({ _id: "counter" }, { $inc: { value: 1 } });
});

await sessionB.withTransaction(async () => {
  // Session B reads the counter and performs an operation
  const counter = await collection.findOne({ _id: "counter" });
  await collection.updateOne({ _id: "total" }, { $inc: { value: counter.value } });
});

await sessionA.endSession();
await sessionB.endSession();
```

In this case, the operations in `sessionB` may violate causal consistency because it reads the `counter` value without considering the update performed by `sessionA`. This could lead to unexpected results in scenarios where the order of operations is critical.

Causal consistency ensures that operations within a session are logically ordered and dependent operations are properly handled. Violating causal consistency may result in unexpected behavior, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a causal relationship between operations.
