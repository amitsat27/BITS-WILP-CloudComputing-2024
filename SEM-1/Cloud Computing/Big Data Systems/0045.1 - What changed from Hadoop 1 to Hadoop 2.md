Hadoop 2, also known as Apache Hadoop 2.x or Hadoop 2, introduced several significant changes and improvements compared to Hadoop 1. The key enhancements include:

1. **High Availability (HA):**
   - One of the most significant additions in Hadoop 2 was the introduction of High Availability for Hadoop's HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) NameNode.
   - In Hadoop 1, the NameNode was a single point of failure. Hadoop 2 introduced the concept of an active and a standby NameNode, ensuring continuous operation even if one node fails.

2. **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):**
   - Hadoop 2 introduced YARN, a resource management layer that enables more flexible and dynamic processing models.
   - YARN separates the resource management and job scheduling functions, allowing multiple applications to share resources efficiently.
   - This replaced the older MapReduce-specific JobTracker and TaskTracker architecture in Hadoop 1.

3. **Multiple Namenodes and HDFS Federation:**
   - Hadoop 2 allows for the configuration of multiple NameNodes (namespaces) within a Hadoop cluster, known as HDFS Federation.
   - Each namespace has its own independent namespace and block pool, enhancing scalability and improving the management of large-scale clusters.

4. **Support for Non-MapReduce Workloads:**
   - With the introduction of YARN, Hadoop 2 expanded beyond its initial MapReduce-centric model. YARN allows different application frameworks to run on Hadoop, not just MapReduce.
   - This opened the door for various distributed data processing frameworks, such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and others, to integrate with Hadoop.

5. **Compatibility and Backward Compatibility:**
   - Hadoop 2 maintained backward compatibility with Hadoop 1, ensuring that existing MapReduce applications could run on Hadoop 2 without modification.
   - This helped organizations smoothly transition to the new version without major disruptions.

6. **Resource Types and Containerization:**
   - YARN introduced the concept of generic resources, allowing different types of resources (memory, CPU, etc.) to be allocated to applications.
   - Containerization became a fundamental concept in YARN. Applications run in containers, and YARN dynamically allocates resources in the form of containers.

7. **Enhanced Security:**
   - Hadoop 2 improved security features with the introduction of Hadoop Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) to encrypt data at rest.
   - It also introduced Hadoop Key Management Server (KMS) for managing encryption keys.

8. **Scalability and Performance Improvements:**
   - Hadoop 2 aimed to improve scalability and performance with enhancements such as the ability to handle larger clusters, more nodes, and better resource utilization.

These changes made Hadoop 2 a more versatile and robust framework, laying the foundation for a broader set of data processing and analytics applications beyond traditional MapReduce jobs.
