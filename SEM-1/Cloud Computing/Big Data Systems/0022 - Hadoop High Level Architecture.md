The Hadoop framework comprises several components that work together to enable the processing and storage of large datasets across distributed clusters. Here's an overview of the high-level architecture of Hadoop:

1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):**
   - HDFS is the primary storage system of Hadoop. It is designed to store very large files across a distributed set of machines. It divides large files into smaller blocks (default is 128MB) and distributes them across nodes in the cluster. HDFS provides fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes.

2. **MapReduce Engine:**
   - The MapReduce engine is the processing component of Hadoop. It is responsible for dividing tasks into smaller subtasks, distributing them across the cluster, and aggregating the results.

3. **Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN):**
   - YARN is the resource management layer of Hadoop. It separates the resource management and job scheduling/monitoring functions. This allows for more efficient and dynamic resource allocation, enabling multiple applications to share resources on the same cluster.

4. **JobTracker and TaskTrackers (Hadoop 1.x):**
   - In Hadoop 1.x, JobTracker is responsible for managing job scheduling and task execution. TaskTrackers are responsible for executing the tasks (both Map and Reduce) on individual nodes.

5. **ResourceManager and NodeManagers (Hadoop 2.x onwards):**
   - In Hadoop 2.x and later versions, ResourceManager takes over the role of JobTracker. It manages resource allocation to applications and schedules jobs. NodeManagers are responsible for managing resources and running tasks on individual nodes.

6. **ApplicationMaster (YARN):**
   - ApplicationMaster is responsible for negotiating resources with the ResourceManager and coordinating the execution of tasks within an application.

7. **Secondary NameNode:**
   - It is not a backup for the primary NameNode, as the name might suggest. It periodically merges the edits log with the current FSImage to reduce the startup time of the NameNode.

8. **NameNode and DataNodes:**
   - The NameNode is the central controller for HDFS. It maintains the metadata and namespace for the file system. DataNodes store actual data blocks and are responsible for managing storage and retrieval.

9. **Client Applications:**
   - These are the applications that interact with Hadoop. They can submit MapReduce jobs, interact with HDFS, and query the cluster for job status and other information.

10. **Hadoop Ecosystem Components:**
    - Alongside the core Hadoop components, there are various other tools and frameworks like Hive, Pig, HBase, Spark, etc., that complement the Hadoop ecosystem. These components extend the capabilities of Hadoop for different data processing tasks.

11. **ZooKeeper (Optional):**
    - ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service often used with Hadoop. It provides synchronization, configuration management, and group services to large distributed systems.

This architecture allows Hadoop to efficiently handle the storage and processing of large datasets across a distributed cluster of commodity hardware. It provides scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability, making it a powerful tool for big data processing.
