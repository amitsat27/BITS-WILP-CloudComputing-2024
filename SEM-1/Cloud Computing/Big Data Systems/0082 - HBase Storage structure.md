HBase, a distributed and scalable NoSQL database, organizes and stores data in a hierarchical structure known as the Bigtable model. Here are the key components of HBase's storage structure:

### 1. **Table:**
- In HBase, data is organized into tables, each identified by a table name.
- Tables can be thought of as similar to tables in relational databases but with a more flexible schema.

### 2. **Row:**
- Tables consist of rows, each identified by a unique row key.
- Row keys are byte arrays, and they are sorted lexicographically in the table.

### 3. **Column Families:**
- Each row is further divided into column families, which are logical groups of columns.
- Column families need to be defined at the time of table creation and cannot be added later.

### 4. **Column Qualifiers:**
- Within a column family, data is stored in columns identified by column qualifiers.
- Columns are specified as `<column_family>:<column_qualifier>`.

### 5. **Cell:**
- The intersection of a row, column family, and column qualifier is called a cell.
- Cells store the actual data and are versioned, allowing multiple versions of the same cell to exist.

### 6. **Timestamp:**
- Each cell version is associated with a timestamp, allowing for versioning of data.
- Timestamps are automatically generated unless specified during data insertion.

### 7. **HFile:**
- The actual data is stored in HFiles, which are sorted, immutable, and compressed files.
- HFiles are the storage files used by HBase to store data on the distributed file system.

### 8. **MemStore:**
- MemStore is an in-memory data structure where new writes are initially stored.
- When MemStore reaches a certain threshold, it flushes to disk, creating new HFiles.

### 9. **WAL (Write-Ahead Log):**
- HBase uses a WAL to record changes before they are applied to the MemStore.
- The WAL ensures durability and recovery in the event of node failures.

### 10. **Region:**
- Tables are divided into regions to enable horizontal scaling.
- Each region contains a contiguous range of row keys and is served by a region server.

### Conclusion:
Understanding the storage structure of HBase is crucial for designing efficient schemas, optimizing performance, and leveraging the distributed and scalable nature of HBase in big data environments.
