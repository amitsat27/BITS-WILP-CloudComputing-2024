Here's a tabular representation of the key differences between SQL (Relational Databases) and NoSQL databases:

| Aspect                   | SQL (Relational Databases)                            | NoSQL                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Data Structure**        | Table-based, structured schema                       | Various data models (document, key-value, column-family, graph) |
| **Schema**                | Rigid schema, predefined tables and columns          | Schema-less or schema-flexible, flexible data structure |
| **Query Language**        | SQL (Structured Query Language)                       | Database-specific query languages or APIs  |
| **ACID Properties**       | Adheres to ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | May sacrifice some ACID properties for performance and scalability |
| **Scalability**           | Scales vertically (adding power to a single server)   | Scales horizontally (adding more servers to a distributed system) |
| **Flexibility**           | Fixed schema                                          | Flexible data structure, allows evolving schema |
| **Consistency**           | Prioritizes consistency                                | May prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency |
| **Use Cases**             | Complex relationships, transactions (financial systems, ERP) | Large and evolving datasets, distributed systems, web applications |

It's important to note that these are generalizations, and specific databases within each category may have variations in features and behavior. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific needs and requirements of the application.
