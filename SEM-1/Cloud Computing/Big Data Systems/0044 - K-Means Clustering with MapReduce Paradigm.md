K-Means clustering can be implemented using the MapReduce paradigm, which allows for distributed processing of large datasets. The process involves two main MapReduce jobs: one for the assignment step and another for the update step. Here's how it can be done:

### Step 1: Initialization

1. **Choose the number of clusters (K)**: This is a hyperparameter that you need to specify in advance.

2. **Initialize cluster centroids**: Randomly select K data points from the dataset and set them as the initial centroids. These points will serve as the starting points for each cluster.

### Step 2: MapReduce Job 1 - Assignment

**Map Phase**:

- **Mapper**: 
  - Input: (Key, Value) pairs representing data points.
  - For each data point, calculate the distance to each centroid and emit (ClusterID, Data Point) pairs, where ClusterID is the ID of the closest centroid.

**Reduce Phase**:

- **Reducer**:
  - Input: (ClusterID, [Data Points]) pairs.
  - For each ClusterID, collect all data points assigned to that cluster.
  - Output: (ClusterID, Updated Centroid) pairs, where Updated Centroid is the mean of all data points in that cluster.

### Step 3: MapReduce Job 2 - Update

**Map Phase**:

- **Mapper**:
  - Input: (ClusterID, Updated Centroid) pairs from Job 1.
  - Emit (ClusterID, Updated Centroid) pairs as output.

**Reduce Phase**:

- **Reducer**:
  - Input: (ClusterID, [Updated Centroids]) pairs.
  - For each ClusterID, calculate the final updated centroid by taking the mean of all the centroids emitted by the mappers.
  - Output: (ClusterID, Final Updated Centroid) pairs.

### Step 4: Repeat MapReduce Jobs

Repeat the MapReduce jobs for a fixed number of iterations or until the centroids no longer change significantly.

### Example:

Let's work through a simple example with a small dataset and assume K=2 for simplicity.

**Dataset**:
```
Data Points: [2, 4, 10, 12, 3, 20, 30, 11, 25]
```

**Initialization**:

Randomly select two initial centroids, let's say `Centroid1 = 4` and `Centroid2 = 10`.

**MapReduce Job 1 - Assignment**:

**Map Phase**:

- Mapper 1:
  - Input: `[2, 4, 10, 12, 3, 20, 30, 11, 25]`
  - Output: `[(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 10), (2, 12), (1, 3), (2, 20), (2, 30), (2, 11), (2, 25)]`

- Mapper 2:
  - Input: `[2, 4, 10, 12, 3, 20, 30, 11, 25]`
  - Output: `[(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 20), (2, 30), (2, 11), (2, 25)]`

**Reduce Phase**:

- Reducer 1:
  - Input: `[(1, [2, 4, 3]), (2, [10, 12, 20, 30, 11, 25])]`
  - Output: `[(1, 3), (2, 17.67)]`

**MapReduce Job 2 - Update**:

**Map Phase**:

- Mapper 1:
  - Input: `[(1, 3), (2, 17.67)]`
  - Output: `[(1, 3), (2, 17.67)]`

**Reduce Phase**:

- Reducer 1:
  - Input: `[(1, [3]), (2, [17.67])]`
  - Output: `[(1, 3), (2, 17.67)]`

Since there is no change in centroids after the second iteration, the algorithm converges and stops.

**Final Clusters**:

- Cluster 1: `[2, 4, 3]`
- Cluster 2: `[10, 12, 20, 30, 11, 25]`

This demonstrates how K-Means can be implemented using the MapReduce paradigm, allowing for distributed processing of large datasets.
