Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a scalable, fully managed file storage service that can be used with Amazon EC2 instances and other AWS services. Here are the complete properties and features of AWS EFS:

1. **Scalability:**
   - EFS can scale seamlessly to petabytes of data, and it can handle thousands of concurrent NFS connections.

2. **Shared File Storage:**
   - EFS provides a shared file system that can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances concurrently. This makes it suitable for workloads that require shared access to files and data across multiple instances.

3. **Network File System (NFS) Protocol:**
   - EFS uses the NFSv4 protocol, which allows Linux EC2 instances to mount EFS file systems as if they were local file systems.

4. **Availability and Durability:**
   - EFS file systems are distributed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region to provide high availability and durability. This means that if one AZ becomes unavailable, you can access your file system from instances in another AZ.

5. **Performance Modes:**
   - EFS supports two performance modes: General Purpose and Max I/O. 
      - **General Purpose (default):** Suitable for a broad spectrum of workloads with small to large file sizes, and it's designed to handle most use cases.
      - **Max I/O:** Optimized for higher-levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second, which can be beneficial for big data and analytics workloads.

6. **Throughput Modes:**
   - EFS offers two throughput modes: Bursting and Provisioned.
      - **Bursting (default):** Scales with the size of the file system and is suitable for most general-purpose workloads.
      - **Provisioned:** Allows you to provision a specific amount of throughput independent of the file system size.

7. **Access Control:**
   - EFS allows you to control access to your file systems through POSIX permissions. You can set permissions at the directory, file, or user/group level.

8. **Integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
   - EFS integrates with IAM, allowing you to control access to your file systems using IAM roles and policies.

9. **Lifecycle Management:**
   - EFS supports lifecycle management policies, which enable you to transition files to the EFS Infrequent Access (IA) storage class after a specified period of time.

10. **Encryption:**
    - EFS supports encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys. Encryption is applied to all files and metadata.

11. **Mount Targets:**
    - EFS uses mount targets to mount file systems on EC2 instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Each mount target has an IP address that you use for mounting the file system.

12. **Data Transfer Acceleration:**
    - EFS provides a feature called EFS-to-EFS Backup, which allows you to efficiently copy data between EFS file systems.

13. **Monitoring and Metrics:**
    - EFS integrates with Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring file system performance and health. Metrics include throughput, burst credit balance, and file system size.

14. **AWS Backup Integration:**
    - EFS integrates with AWS Backup, allowing you to create backups of your file systems and recover them using AWS Backup.

15. **Data Sync (EFS-to-EFS):**
    - EFS supports the Data Sync feature, which enables you to easily copy files between EFS file systems and on-premises servers.

16. **Costs:**
    - EFS pricing is based on the amount of storage used and the provisioned throughput (if using Provisioned Throughput mode).

These properties make AWS EFS suitable for a wide range of use cases, including content repositories, development environments, web server farms, and big data analytics workloads that require shared file storage.
