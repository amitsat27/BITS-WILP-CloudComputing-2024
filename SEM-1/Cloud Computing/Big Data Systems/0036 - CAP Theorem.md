CAP Theorem, also known as Brewer's Theorem, is a fundamental principle in distributed systems that states that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously achieve all three of the following guarantees:

1. **Consistency (C)**: All nodes in the system have the same view of the data at the same time, regardless of which node you access.

2. **Availability (A)**: The system remains operational and responsive, even in the presence of failures. Every request receives a response, although it might not be the most up-to-date.

3. **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate and make progress even if some messages between nodes are lost or delayed. This means the system can function even when the network is unreliable or experiences delays.

The CAP Theorem asserts that in the event of a network partition (P), a trade-off must be made between either consistency (C) or availability (A). This means that a distributed system can, at most, guarantee two out of the three properties.

Here are the common scenarios according to the CAP Theorem:

1. **CP Systems**: These prioritize Consistency and Partition Tolerance over Availability. In the event of a network partition, they will restrict access to some nodes to maintain consistency. Examples include traditional relational databases.

2. **AP Systems**: These prioritize Availability and Partition Tolerance over strong Consistency. In the event of a network partition, they will continue to serve requests, potentially providing inconsistent data. Examples include many NoSQL databases and distributed cache systems.

3. **CA Systems**: These try to achieve both strong Consistency and Availability but do not prioritize Partition Tolerance. They are not designed to function in the presence of network partitions. Examples are single-node databases that do not have distributed capabilities.

It's important to note that CAP does not mean that one property is completely sacrificed for the other two. It simply means that, in the face of network partitions, trade-offs must be made in terms of the level of consistency and availability a system can provide.

Architects and developers must carefully consider which aspects of CAP are most critical for their specific application, and choose their system's design and technology accordingly.
