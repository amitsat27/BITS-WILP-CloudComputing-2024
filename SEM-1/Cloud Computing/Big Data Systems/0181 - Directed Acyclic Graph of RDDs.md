In Apache Spark, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a fundamental concept that represents the logical execution plan of a Spark job. The DAG describes the sequence of stages and tasks that need to be executed to fulfill the transformations and actions specified on Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs).

### Components of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):

1. **RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets):**
   - RDDs represent distributed collections of data that can be processed in parallel.
   - Each RDD in the DAG represents a stage in the computation.

2. **Transformations:**
   - Transformations are the operations applied to RDDs to create new RDDs.
   - Examples of transformations include `map`, `filter`, `groupBy`, etc.
   - Transformations create a logical dependency between the parent and child RDDs.

3. **Actions:**
   - Actions are operations that trigger the execution of the computation plan and produce a result or output.
   - Examples of actions include `collect`, `count`, `saveAsTextFile`, etc.

4. **Stages:**
   - A stage is a set of transformations that can be executed in parallel without data shuffling.
   - Stages are determined based on the presence of narrow or wide transformations.
   - Narrow transformations result in one-to-one dependencies between partitions, while wide transformations require data shuffling and result in a new stage.

5. **Tasks:**
   - A task is the smallest unit of work in Spark and represents the execution of a single transformation on a single partition of data.
   - Tasks are the actual units of computation that are sent to the Spark executors for execution.

### Example DAG:

Let's consider a simple example with two transformations and an action:

```python
# Sample RDD
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)

# Transformations
mapped_rdd = rdd.map(lambda x: x * 2)
filtered_rdd = mapped_rdd.filter(lambda x: x % 4 == 0)

# Action
result = filtered_rdd.collect()
```

In this example, the DAG can be visualized as follows:

```
            +---(Map)---+
            |           |
   (Parallelize)   RDD 2 (Filtered)
            |           |
            +---(Filter)--+
                    |
              RDD 3 (Collected)
                    |
            +---(Collect)---+
```

- **Stage 1 (Map):**
  - Input: RDD 1 (Parallelized collection)
  - Transformation: Map
  - Output: RDD 2

- **Stage 2 (Filter):**
  - Input: RDD 2 (Result of the map transformation)
  - Transformation: Filter
  - Output: RDD 3

- **Stage 3 (Collect):**
  - Input: RDD 3 (Result of the filter transformation)
  - Action: Collect (triggers execution)
  - Output: Result

This DAG illustrates the logical flow of transformations and actions, showing the dependencies between RDDs and the stages they belong to.

It's important to note that Spark optimizes the execution plan based on the DAG, and it may perform optimizations like pipelining narrow transformations within a stage and minimizing data shuffling to improve performance. The DAG is a crucial concept for understanding the structure and execution flow of Spark jobs.
