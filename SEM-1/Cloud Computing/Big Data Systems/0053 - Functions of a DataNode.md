In the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), DataNodes play a crucial role in storing and managing the actual data blocks of files. Here are the key functions of a DataNode:

1. **Block Storage:**
   - **Storage of Data Blocks:** DataNodes are responsible for storing the actual data blocks that make up files in the HDFS.

2. **Heartbeat and Health Monitoring:**
   - **Heartbeat Signals:** DataNodes send periodic heartbeat signals to the NameNode. These heartbeats indicate that the DataNodes are alive and functioning.
   - **Health Status Monitoring:** The NameNode uses heartbeats to monitor the health and responsiveness of each DataNode. Unresponsive or failed DataNodes are detected based on missed heartbeats.

3. **Block Report Generation:**
   - **Block Information:** DataNodes generate block reports that contain information about the blocks they are storing. These reports include details such as block IDs, block states, and the names of files to which the blocks belong.
   - **Periodic Sending:** Block reports are sent to the NameNode periodically. They help the NameNode maintain an up-to-date view of block locations and health.

4. **Block Replication:**
   - **Replication Requests:** When the NameNode determines that the replication factor for a block is below the desired level, it instructs DataNodes to replicate the block.
   - **Block Copies:** DataNodes create additional copies of blocks to meet the replication factor, ensuring data availability and fault tolerance.

5. **Block Deletion:**
   - **Block Removal:** DataNodes delete blocks when instructed by the NameNode. This can happen when a file is deleted or when the replication factor needs adjustment.

6. **Client Read and Write Operations:**
   - **Data Transfer:** DataNodes facilitate the transfer of data between clients and the HDFS. Clients can read data from and write data to DataNodes.
   - **Block Streaming:** DataNodes stream data directly to clients during read operations and accept data streams during write operations.

7. **Checksum Verification:**
   - **Data Integrity Checks:** DataNodes verify the integrity of stored blocks by performing checksum verification. This ensures that the data blocks have not been corrupted.

8. **Block Scanner:**
   - **Periodic Scans:** DataNodes may run a block scanner to detect and report corrupted blocks or blocks with checksum mismatches.
   - **Reporting to NameNode:** Issues detected by the block scanner are reported to the NameNode, which can then take corrective action.

9. **Caching:**
   - **Read Caching:** Some DataNodes may implement read caching to improve the performance of read operations by storing frequently accessed data in memory.

10. **DataNode Decommissioning:**
    - **Graceful Decommissioning:** When a DataNode is decommissioned or taken out of service, it notifies the NameNode, and the NameNode ensures that block replication is adjusted accordingly.

11. **DataNode Re-Registration:**
    - **Re-Registration:** DataNodes periodically re-register with the NameNode to provide updated information about their status and block storage.

12. **Handling Disk Failures:**
    - **Disk Failure Detection:** DataNodes detect disk failures and report them to the NameNode, allowing for corrective measures.

DataNodes, in conjunction with the NameNode, form a robust and fault-tolerant architecture that ensures the availability, reliability, and scalability of the Hadoop Distributed File System.
