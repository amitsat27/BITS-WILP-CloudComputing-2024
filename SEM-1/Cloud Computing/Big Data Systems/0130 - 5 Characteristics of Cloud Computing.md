Cloud computing is characterized by five essential characteristics, often referred to as the "NIST Cloud Computing Characteristics." These characteristics define the fundamental nature of cloud services and distinguish them from traditional computing models. Here are the five key characteristics:

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:**
   - **Definition:** Users can provision and manage computing resources, such as server instances, storage, and network bandwidth, as needed, without requiring human intervention from the service provider.
   - **Example:** A user can deploy a virtual machine, scale up storage, or add network resources through a self-service portal without direct interaction with the cloud provider's support.

2. **Broad Network Access:**
   - **Definition:** Cloud services are accessible over the network and can be accessed through standard mechanisms, promoting the use of diverse client devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
   - **Example:** Users can access cloud applications and data from any device with internet connectivity, allowing for flexibility and remote access.

3. **Resource Pooling:**
   - **Definition:** Computing resources are pooled and shared among multiple users, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned based on demand.
   - **Example:** Multiple users or tenants share underlying physical servers, storage, and networking infrastructure, optimizing resource utilization and improving efficiency.

4. **Rapid Elasticity:**
   - **Definition:** Cloud resources can be rapidly scaled up or down to accommodate changes in demand. Scalability is often automated to provide quick and efficient adjustments.
   - **Example:** An application can automatically scale the number of server instances in response to increased traffic and scale down during periods of low demand, ensuring optimal resource usage and cost efficiency.

5. **Measured Service:**
   - **Definition:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage by leveraging metering capabilities. Service providers measure and monitor resource usage, and users are billed based on their consumption.
   - **Example:** Users are charged based on the number of virtual machines, storage space, or data transfer bandwidth they consume, providing a pay-as-you-go model that aligns costs with actual usage.

These characteristics collectively define the agility, flexibility, and efficiency that cloud computing offers. They enable users to access and manage computing resources dynamically, responding to changing business needs while paying only for the resources consumed.
