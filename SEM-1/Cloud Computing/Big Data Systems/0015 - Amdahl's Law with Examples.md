Amdahl's Law is a principle in computer architecture and parallel computing that helps to predict the theoretical speedup in performance that can be achieved by using multiple processors for a given task. It's based on the observation that not all parts of a program can be parallelized.

The formula for Amdahl's Law is:

$\[Speedup = \frac{1}{{(1 - P) + \frac{P}{N}}}\]$

Where:
- $\(P\)$ is the fraction of the program that can be parallelized.
- $\(N\)$ is the number of processors.
- $\((1 - P)\)$ represents the serial portion of the program.
- $\(\frac{P}{N}\)$ represents the parallelizable portion of the program.

### Example:

Let's say we have a task where 20% of it is inherently serial (cannot be parallelized), and 80% can be executed in parallel. We'll calculate the speedup for $\(N = 2\) and \(N = 8\)$.

Given:
- $\(P = 0.8\)$ (80% is parallelizable)
- $\(1 - P = 0.2\)$ (20% is serial)

### For \(N = 2\):

$\[Speedup_{N=2} = \frac{1}{{(1 - 0.8) + \frac{0.8}{2}}} = \frac{1}{{0.2 + 0.4}} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67\]$

### For \(N = 8\):

$\[Speedup_{N=8} = \frac{1}{{(1 - 0.8) + \frac{0.8}{8}}} = \frac{1}{{0.2 + 0.1}} = \frac{1}{0.3} \approx 3.33\]$

### Percentage Improvement:

The percentage improvement going from \(N = 2\) to \(N = 8\) can be calculated using the formula:

$\[Percentage Improvement = \frac{{Speedup_{N=8} - Speedup_{N=2}}}{{Speedup_{N=2}}} \times 100\%\]$

$\[Percentage Improvement = \frac{{3.33 - 1.67}}{{1.67}} \times 100\% \approx 100\%\]$

So, going from 2 processors to 8 processors for this task with 20% serial and 80% parallelizable portions leads to approximately a 100% improvement in speedup according to Amdahl's Law.
