In a system with parallel components, the MTTF (Mean Time To Failure) is indeed calculated as the sum of the MTTFs of the individual components. 

Mathematically, it is represented as:

$\[MTTF_{\text{system}} = MTTF_A + MTTF_B + MTTF_C\]$

This means that if any of the components A, B, or C fail, the system as a whole will still operate because the other components are still functioning. The system will only fail when all components have failed.

### Example:

Let's consider an electronic system with three parallel components: Component A, Component B, and Component C. The MTTF values for each component are as follows:

- $\(MTTF_A = 10,000\)$ hours
- $\(MTTF_B = 8,000\)$ hours
- $\(MTTF_C = 12,000\)$ hours

Using the formula, we can calculate the MTTF of the entire system:

$\[MTTF_{\text{system}} = MTTF_A + MTTF_B + MTTF_C\]$

$\[MTTF_{\text{system}} = 10,000 \text{ hours} + 8,000 \text{ hours} + 12,000 \text{ hours} = 30,000 \text{ hours}\]$

So, the MTTF of the entire system is 30,000 hours. This means that, on average, the system can be expected to operate for about 30,000 hours before a failure occurs.
