In MongoDB, write concerns define the level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB for write operations. They determine the number of nodes (replica set members) that must acknowledge a write operation before the operation is considered successful. Here are some common write concerns:

1. **w: 0 (Unacknowledged):**
   - No acknowledgment of the write operation is requested.
   - The write operation is considered successful even if it has not been replicated to any node.

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John" }, { writeConcern: { w: 0 } });
```

2. **w: 1 (Acknowledged):**
   - Acknowledgment is requested from the primary node only.
   - The write operation is considered successful if it has been written to the primary.

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John" }, { writeConcern: { w: 1 } });
```

3. **w: majority (Majority Acknowledged):**
   - Acknowledgment is requested from the majority of the replica set members.
   - The write operation is considered successful if it has been acknowledged by a majority of the nodes.

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John" }, { writeConcern: { w: "majority" } });
```

4. **w: "tag" (Tag Acknowledged):**
   - Acknowledgment is requested from nodes with a specific tag.
   - Useful for targeting write operations to nodes with specific characteristics, such as geographical location.

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John" }, { writeConcern: { w: "tag", wTag: "east-coast" } });
```

5. **j: true (Journal Acknowledged):**
   - Requests acknowledgment only after the write operation has been committed to the journal on the primary node.

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John" }, { writeConcern: { j: true } });
```

### Example:

```javascript
// Assuming the collection has documents with field 'name'

// Unacknowledged Write
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John" }, { writeConcern: { w: 0 } });

// Acknowledged Write
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John" }, { writeConcern: { w: 1 } });

// Majority Acknowledged Write
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John" }, { writeConcern: { w: "majority" } });

// Tag Acknowledged Write
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John" }, { writeConcern: { w: "tag", wTag: "east-coast" } });

// Journal Acknowledged Write
db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John" }, { writeConcern: { j: true } });
```

Write concerns allow developers to control the level of durability and acknowledgment required for write operations based on the specific needs of their applications. The choice of write concern depends on factors such as data safety requirements, latency tolerance, and network conditions.
