Here's a comparison table between parallel and distributed computing:

| Aspect                   | Parallel Computing                | Distributed Computing              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | Simultaneous execution of tasks on multiple processors within a single system. | Multiple computers working together over a network to achieve a common goal. Each has its own memory and processing capabilities. |
| **Communication**        | Shared Memory                     | Message Passing over a Network     |
| **Latency**              | Low (Due to shared memory)         | Potentially Higher (Due to network communication) |
| **Synchronization**      | Easier (Shared memory)            | More Complex (No shared memory)    |
| **Suitability**          | Tasks involving frequent communication and data sharing. | Large-scale tasks that can be divided into independent subtasks, without requiring frequent communication. |
| **Example**              | Multi-Core Processors             | MapReduce (Large-scale data processing) |
| **Performance Scaling**  | Limited Scalability               | High Scalability                   |
| **Complexity in Programming** | Relatively Easier            | More Challenging                   |

Remember that the choice between parallel and distributed computing depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the task at hand. Some applications may even benefit from a combination of both approaches.
