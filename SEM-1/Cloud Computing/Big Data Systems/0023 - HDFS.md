Brief overview of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) basics, block sizes, and the main differences between Hadoop 1.x and 2.x:

### HDFS Basics:

**Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):**
- HDFS is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications. It is designed to store and manage very large files across a distributed cluster of commodity hardware.

**Key Features:**
- **Distributed:** HDFS divides large files into smaller blocks, which are then distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster.
- **Fault-Tolerant:** HDFS replicates each block across multiple nodes to ensure data durability and fault tolerance.
- **Scalable:** HDFS can handle petabytes of data and can be easily scaled by adding more nodes to the cluster.
- **High Throughput:** It provides high data transfer rates, making it suitable for applications with large datasets.

**Components:**
- **NameNode:** Manages the metadata and namespace of the file system. It keeps track of the structure of the file system tree and the metadata for all the files and directories.
- **DataNode:** Stores the actual data blocks. Each DataNode manages the storage attached to its node and periodically sends heartbeats and block reports to the NameNode.

### Block Sizes:

**Block Size in HDFS:**
- In HDFS, large files are divided into fixed-size blocks (typically 128MB or 256MB in size). These blocks are then distributed across the DataNodes in the cluster.

**Advantages of Large Blocks:**
- Reduces the metadata overhead, as there are fewer blocks to manage.
- Helps in minimizing the impact of seek time, as a single seek can read a large amount of data.
- Decreases the likelihood of data fragmentation.

### Main Differences between Hadoop 1.x and 2.x:

**1. Resource Management:**
- **Hadoop 1.x:** Used a MapReduce-only framework. The JobTracker was responsible for resource management (scheduling, tracking, etc.).
- **Hadoop 2.x (YARN):** Introduced YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) as a resource management layer. It decouples resource management from the processing model and allows multiple applications to share the same cluster resources.

**2. Scalability:**
- **Hadoop 1.x:** Scaled horizontally for MapReduce processing, but faced limitations in terms of supporting other types of processing models.
- **Hadoop 2.x (YARN):** Provides a more scalable and flexible platform by allowing various processing models (e.g., MapReduce, Spark, Flink) to run on the same cluster.

**3. High Availability (HA):**
- **Hadoop 1.x:** Did not have native support for high availability. NameNode was a single point of failure.
- **Hadoop 2.x:** Introduced High Availability for the NameNode, allowing for a standby NameNode to take over in case of a failure.

**4. Resource Utilization:**
- **Hadoop 1.x:** Resource utilization was primarily optimized for MapReduce jobs.
- **Hadoop 2.x (YARN):** Allows for more efficient utilization of resources by supporting multiple types of workloads beyond just MapReduce.

**5. Compatibility:**
- **Hadoop 1.x:** Was not designed to support newer processing frameworks like Apache Spark, Apache Flink, etc.
- **Hadoop 2.x (YARN):** Offers compatibility with various processing frameworks through the YARN resource manager.

In summary, Hadoop 2.x with YARN introduced significant improvements in resource management, scalability, high availability, and compatibility with various processing frameworks, making it a more versatile and powerful platform compared to Hadoop 1.x.
