The availability of a system is a measure of its readiness to perform its intended function over a specified period of time. It takes into account factors like downtime due to failures and maintenance.

The availability $(\(A\))$ of a system can be calculated using the following formula:

$\[A = \frac{MTTF}{MTTF + MTTR}\]$

Where:
- $\(MTTF\)$ is the Mean Time To Failure.
- $\(MTTR\)$ is the Mean Time To Repair.
  
Additionally, if we include MTTD in the calculation, the formula becomes:

$\[A = \frac{MTTF}{MTTF + MTTD + MTTR}\]$

This modified formula accounts for the time it takes to detect a failure in addition to the time to repair.

### Interpretation:

- $\(MTTF\)$: The average time a system operates before it fails.
- $\(MTTD\)$: The average time it takes to detect that a failure has occurred.
- $\(MTTR\)$: The average time it takes to repair a failed system.

### Example:

Let's consider an example:

- $\(MTTF = 10,000\)$ hours
- $\(MTTD = 500\)$ hours (time to detect a failure)
- $\(MTTR = 2,000\)$ hours (time to repair a failure)

Using the modified availability formula:

$\[A = \frac{MTTF}{MTTF + MTTD + MTTR}\]$

$\[A = \frac{10,000}{10,000 + 500 + 2,000} \approx 0.804\]$

In this example, the system's availability is approximately 80.4%. This means that the system is available and operational for about 80.4% of the time, considering the time it takes for failures to be detected and repaired.

Remember that higher availability indicates a more reliable system.
