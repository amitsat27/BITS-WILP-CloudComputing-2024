Regression and classification are two major types of supervised learning tasks in machine learning, and they involve predicting different types of outcomes based on input data.

### Regression:

1. **Definition:**
   - Regression is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a continuous output variable.
   - The output variable is numeric and can take any value within a given range.

2. **Examples:**
   - Predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
   - Forecasting stock prices based on historical data.
   - Estimating the temperature based on weather-related features.

3. **Output:**
   - The output is a continuous value, and the algorithm aims to learn the relationship between input features and the target variable.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Common evaluation metrics for regression tasks include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

### Classification:

1. **Definition:**
   - Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a categorical output variable, which is usually a label or class.
   - The output variable is discrete and belongs to a predefined set of classes.

2. **Examples:**
   - Identifying whether an email is spam or not spam.
   - Classifying images of handwritten digits into the digits 0-9.
   - Predicting whether a loan application will be approved or denied.

3. **Output:**
   - The output is a class label, and the algorithm learns to map input features to the corresponding class labels.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

### Key Differences:

1. **Nature of Output:**
   - Regression predicts continuous values.
   - Classification predicts categorical labels.

2. **Examples:**
   - In regression, examples include predicting prices, temperatures, or stock values.
   - In classification, examples include predicting classes like spam/not spam, dog/cat, or approved/denied.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Regression uses metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
   - Classification uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve.

4. **Decision Boundaries:**
   - In regression, the model learns a smooth curve or surface to predict continuous values.
   - In classification, the model learns decision boundaries that separate different classes.

5. **Output Space:**
   - The output space in regression is an interval or range of continuous values.
   - The output space in classification is a set of discrete classes.

In summary, the choice between regression and classification depends on the nature of the target variable. If the target is continuous, regression is appropriate. If the target is categorical, classification is the suitable approach. Each type of task requires different algorithms and evaluation metrics.
