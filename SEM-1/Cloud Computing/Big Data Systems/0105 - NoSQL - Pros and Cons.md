**Pros of NoSQL:**

1. **Flexibility and Schema-less Design:**
   - NoSQL databases are schema-less or schema-flexible, allowing developers to store and retrieve data without a predefined structure. This flexibility is beneficial for handling diverse and evolving data types.

2. **Scalability:**
   - NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, enabling them to handle large amounts of data and traffic by adding more servers to the database cluster. This makes them suitable for applications with growing datasets.

3. **High Performance:**
   - Many NoSQL databases are optimized for specific use cases, providing high-performance reads and writes. They often use efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms tailored to the nature of the data.

4. **Support for Unstructured and Semi-Structured Data:**
   - NoSQL databases can handle unstructured and semi-structured data, making them suitable for scenarios where the data doesn't fit neatly into tables or rows, such as JSON documents or graph structures.

5. **Horizontal Partitioning and Sharding:**
   - NoSQL databases can easily distribute data across multiple servers through horizontal partitioning or sharding. This ensures that each server in a cluster only handles a portion of the data, improving overall performance.

6. **Cost-Effective:**
   - NoSQL databases often run on commodity hardware and are open source, making them cost-effective compared to traditional relational databases.

**Cons of NoSQL:**

1. **Lack of Standardization:**
   - There is no standardized query language (like SQL for relational databases) for NoSQL databases. Each database may have its own query language, making it challenging for developers to switch between different databases.

2. **Limited Transaction Support:**
   - Some NoSQL databases sacrifice transaction support (ACID properties) in favor of performance and scalability. This makes them less suitable for use cases that require strong consistency and transactional integrity.

3. **Learning Curve:**
   - NoSQL databases often require developers to learn new concepts and APIs, which can be a challenge for those accustomed to relational databases and SQL.

4. **Not Suitable for Complex Queries:**
   - NoSQL databases may not be the best choice for complex queries involving multiple tables or relationships. Their strength lies in simple queries on large datasets.

5. **Data Consistency Trade-offs:**
   - Some NoSQL databases may prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency (CAP theorem). This can lead to eventual consistency, where different nodes in the database may temporarily have different views of the data.

6. **Maturity and Support:**
   - While some NoSQL databases are mature and widely adopted, others may be relatively new or have limited community support. This can affect the availability of tools, libraries, and expertise.

The choice between NoSQL and traditional relational databases depends on the specific requirements of the application. NoSQL databases are well-suited for scenarios where flexibility, scalability, and performance are critical, while relational databases excel in use cases requiring complex transactions and strict data consistency.
