Live migration is a technique used in virtualization to move a running virtual machine (VM) from one physical host to another with little to no downtime. This is particularly useful for load balancing, resource optimization, and maintenance activities. Different virtualization platforms use various names for live migration; for example:

1. **VMware vSphere:** VMware calls its live migration feature "vMotion."
2. **Microsoft Hyper-V:** Microsoft refers to live migration as "Live Migration."
3. **KVM/QEMU:** In the context of KVM-based virtualization, live migration is often referred to as "live migration" or "online migration."

Here's a general overview of the live migration process:

### 1. **Preconditions and Prerequisites:**
   - **Shared Storage:** VMs should be stored on shared storage accessible by both the source and destination hosts.
   - **Network Connectivity:** Ensure that there is sufficient network bandwidth and low latency between the source and destination hosts.
   - **Compatible Hosts:** The source and destination hosts should have compatible hardware and configurations.

### 2. **Configuration:**
   - Configure your virtualization platform to enable live migration. This includes setting up shared storage, configuring network settings, and ensuring that both hosts are part of the same virtualization cluster or environment.

### 3. **Initiate Live Migration:**
   - Depending on the virtualization platform, use the appropriate interface or tool to initiate live migration. This might involve selecting the VM to be migrated, specifying the destination host, and confirming the migration.

### 4. **Pre-Migration Checks:**
   - The virtualization platform typically performs pre-migration checks to ensure that the migration can proceed without issues. This includes checking resource availability, compatibility, and connectivity.

### 5. **Data Transfer:**
   - The live migration process involves transferring the memory, storage, and network state of the running VM from the source host to the destination host in real-time.

### 6. **Iterative Updates:**
   - During the migration, the VM's memory pages are iteratively updated on the destination host to keep it in sync with the source. Any changes made to the VM during the migration are tracked and transferred.

### 7. **Completion:**
   - Once the VM's state is fully transferred and synchronized, the virtualization platform completes the migration process. The VM is then running on the destination host, and the source host releases its resources.

### 8. **Post-Migration Steps:**
   - Verify the successful completion of the live migration.
   - Update any references to the VM's location if necessary.
   - Monitor the VM on the destination host to ensure normal operation.

### 9. **Rollback (if necessary):**
   - In the event of any issues during migration, many virtualization platforms provide the option to roll back the migration to the source host.

### 10. **Documentation:**
   - Document the live migration process, including configurations, settings, and any issues encountered. This documentation is valuable for future reference and troubleshooting.

Live migration is a powerful feature that enhances the flexibility and manageability of virtualized environments, allowing for dynamic resource allocation and efficient maintenance activities without disrupting services. It's important to follow best practices and thoroughly test the live migration process to ensure a smooth and reliable experience.
