Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, analytics, software, and intelligence, over the internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, individuals and businesses can access these resources on-demand from cloud service providers.

Key characteristics of cloud computing include:

1. **On-Demand Self-Service:** Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed, without requiring human intervention from the service provider.

2. **Broad Network Access:** Cloud services are accessible over the internet from a variety of devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

3. **Resource Pooling:** Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple customers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.

4. **Rapid Elasticity:** Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to accommodate changes in demand. Users only pay for the resources they consume.

5. **Measured Service:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction. Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and the consumer.

Cloud computing services are typically categorized into three main service models:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform that includes infrastructure, development tools, and services to help developers build, deploy, and scale applications more easily.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access the software without needing to install, manage, or maintain it.

Cloud computing providers include major companies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, and others. These providers offer a variety of services across different cloud deployment models, including public, private, and hybrid clouds.

Cloud computing has become a foundational technology for businesses and individuals, enabling them to scale and innovate without the need for significant upfront investments in physical infrastructure. It has transformed the way IT services are delivered and consumed, providing agility, cost savings, and flexibility.
