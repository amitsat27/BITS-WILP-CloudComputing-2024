Docker provides several network drivers that allow containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world. Each network driver serves a specific purpose and has its own features and use cases. Here are some of the common Docker container network drivers:

1. **Bridge Network**:

   - **Purpose**: Default network driver. It allows containers to communicate on the same Docker host.
   
   - **Features**:
     - Containers on a bridge network can communicate with each other using container names.
     - Containers on the same bridge network can communicate directly without requiring port mapping.
   
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Communication between containers on the same host.
     - Containers running applications that need to connect to each other.

   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     docker network create my_bridge_network
     docker run -d --network my_bridge_network --name container1 my_image
     docker run -d --network my_bridge_network --name container2 my_image
     ```

2. **Host Network**:

   - **Purpose**: Removes network isolation between the container and the host system. The container uses the host's network stack directly.
   
   - **Features**:
     - Containers using the host network can access ports on the host system without port mapping.
     - Network performance can be higher since there's no additional network layer.

   - **Use Cases**:
     - When a container requires access to services on the host machine.
     - When high network performance is critical.

   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --network host my_image
     ```

3. **Overlay Network**:

   - **Purpose**: Enables communication between containers across multiple Docker hosts in a Swarm cluster.
   
   - **Features**:
     - Containers on different hosts can communicate using overlay networking.
     - Automatically encrypts communication between containers.

   - **Use Cases**:
     - Applications running in a Docker Swarm cluster that need to communicate across multiple hosts.

   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     docker network create -d overlay my_overlay_network
     ```

4. **Macvlan Network**:

   - **Purpose**: Allows containers to have their own MAC addresses and appear as physical devices on the network.
   
   - **Features**:
     - Containers can have their own unique MAC addresses and can be treated like physical devices on the network.
     - Useful for scenarios where containers need to be directly exposed on the network.

   - **Use Cases**:
     - When containers need to appear as separate devices on the network, each with its own IP and MAC address.
     - Containers used in scenarios requiring direct access to the network, such as with certain IoT applications.

   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.1 -o parent=eth0 my_macvlan_network
     ```

5. **None Network**:

   - **Purpose**: Disables all networking for a container.
   
   - **Features**:
     - Containers on the `none` network have no network access.

   - **Use Cases**:
     - For situations where a container doesn't need network access.

   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --network none my_image
     ```

These are some of the common network drivers provided by Docker. Each driver has its specific use cases, and the choice of network driver depends on the requirements of your application and the infrastructure setup.
