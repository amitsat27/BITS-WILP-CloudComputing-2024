**Community Cloud Key Characteristics**:

1. **Shared Infrastructure for a Specific Community**: A community cloud is a cloud computing environment that is shared by a specific group of organizations or entities with common interests, such as industry-specific regulatory requirements.

2. **Limited Access**: Access to the community cloud is restricted to members of the community, ensuring that only authorized users have access to the shared resources.

3. **Joint Governance**: Members of the community often have a say in the governance and policies of the community cloud, allowing them to collectively define rules and standards.

4. **Tailored to Community Needs**: Community clouds are designed to meet the specific requirements, compliance standards, and industry regulations of the community they serve.

**Pros of Community Cloud**:

1. **Shared Costs**: Members of the community share the costs of infrastructure, which can lead to cost savings compared to individual organizations deploying their own private clouds.

2. **Compliance and Security**: Community clouds can be tailored to meet specific industry compliance requirements, ensuring that all members adhere to the same standards.

3. **Collaboration and Resource Sharing**: Organizations within the community can collaborate more effectively by sharing resources and data in a trusted environment.

4. **Customization for Specific Use Cases**: Community clouds can be customized to meet the unique needs and workflows of the specific industry or community they serve.

5. **Joint Governance and Control**: Members have a collective say in governance, policies, and management of the community cloud, providing a sense of ownership and control.

**Cons of Community Cloud**:

1. **Limited to Specific Community**: Access to the community cloud is restricted to members of the defined community, which may limit the potential pool of users.

2. **Complex Governance and Agreement Process**: Establishing governance, policies, and agreements among multiple organizations can be complex and require careful negotiation.

3. **Potential for Conflict**: Differences in priorities, requirements, or opinions among community members may lead to conflicts in governance and decision-making.

4. **Resource Allocation Challenges**: Balancing resource allocation among community members to ensure fairness and efficiency can be challenging.

5. **Dependence on Trust and Collaboration**: Effective collaboration and trust among community members are crucial for the success of a community cloud.

Overall, community clouds are particularly well-suited for industries or communities with shared interests and specific regulatory requirements. They provide a balance between the customization of private clouds and the shared resources of public clouds, offering a trusted environment for collaboration and resource sharing. The success of a community cloud depends on effective governance, collaboration, and adherence to shared standards.
