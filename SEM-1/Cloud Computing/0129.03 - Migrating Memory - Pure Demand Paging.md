Pure Demand Paging, in the context of virtualization and memory migration, refers to a memory migration technique where only the actively used or demanded portions of a virtual machine's (VM) memory are transferred from the source host to the destination host. This approach aims to minimize the amount of data transferred over the network during migration, focusing on the pages that are currently in use by the VM.

Here is an overview of the key aspects of Pure Demand Paging memory migration:

### How Pure Demand Paging Works:

1. **Identifying Active Pages:**
   - The virtualization platform monitors the VM's memory usage and identifies the pages that are actively in use by the VM.

2. **Copying Active Pages:**
   - Only the actively used memory pages are copied from the source host to the destination host. This minimizes the amount of data transferred over the network.

3. **Continual Transfer:**
   - The migration process continues iteratively, transferring the actively used pages to the destination host in an incremental manner.

4. **Transparent to the VM:**
   - The VM remains unaware of the ongoing migration process, and its operation continues with minimal disruption.

5. **Completion and Switch:**
   - Once a sufficient portion of the actively used pages is transferred to the destination host, the VM's execution is switched to the new host.

### Pros of Pure Demand Paging Memory Migration:

1. **Reduced Downtime:**
   - By focusing on actively used memory pages, Pure Demand Paging aims to minimize the downtime experienced by the VM during migration.

2. **Efficient Use of Resources:**
   - The approach is resource-efficient as it avoids transferring unnecessary or idle memory pages, reducing the network and storage overhead.

### Cons of Pure Demand Paging Memory Migration:

1. **Incremental Transfer Overhead:**
   - The iterative transfer of actively used pages can introduce additional overhead, especially if the VM is actively modifying its memory state during the migration process.

2. **Migration Duration:**
   - The migration process might take longer as it relies on continual transfers of memory pages, especially in scenarios with high memory utilization.

3. **Resource Usage:**
   - Both the source and destination hosts need to manage resources effectively to ensure a smooth and efficient migration process.

### Use Cases:

The Pure Demand Paging memory migration approach might be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Balancing Downtime and Efficiency:**
  - For workloads where minimizing downtime is essential, and the trade-off of incremental transfer overhead is acceptable.

- **Large VMs with Varying Usage:**
  - For larger VMs with varying memory usage patterns, where transferring only the actively used pages can be more efficient.

- **Continuous Operation:**
  - When maintaining continuous operation is critical, and the VM can tolerate a more gradual migration process.

### Considerations:

- **Network Bandwidth:**
  - Adequate network bandwidth is crucial for efficiently transferring actively used memory pages between hosts.

- **Memory Usage Patterns:**
  - The effectiveness of Pure Demand Paging depends on the VM's memory usage patterns. Workloads with significant variations in memory demand may benefit more.

- **Migration Planning:**
  - Planning and coordination are important to ensure a smooth migration process, and administrators should consider factors such as application sensitivity to downtime.

While Pure Demand Paging seeks to reduce downtime by focusing on actively used memory pages, it's important to evaluate its suitability based on the specific characteristics of the VM, the workload, and the available network and compute resources. Alternative live migration techniques should also be considered based on the requirements of the virtualized environment.
