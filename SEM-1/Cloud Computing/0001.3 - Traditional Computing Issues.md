In a traditional computing approach (where applications and data are stored and processed locally on individual devices), users may face several difficulties:

1. **Limited Computing Resources**:

   - **Hardware Constraints**: Individual users may have limited processing power, memory, and storage on their personal devices. This can lead to slower performance and an inability to run resource-intensive applications.

   - **Storage Capacity**: Users may run out of local storage space, leading to the need for external storage solutions or regular purging of files.

   - **Upgrade Costs**: Upgrading hardware components (e.g., RAM, CPU, storage) can be expensive and may require technical expertise.

2. **Data Accessibility and Synchronization**:

   - **Data Accessibility Across Devices**: Maintaining consistent access to files and applications across multiple devices (e.g., desktop, laptop, smartphone) can be challenging without cloud-based solutions.

   - **Synchronization Issues**: Keeping data synchronized between different devices and ensuring that the most up-to-date version is available can be complex and may require manual effort.

   - **Data Backup and Recovery**: Users are responsible for their own data backup and recovery, which can be prone to human error or equipment failure.

3. **Security and Privacy Concerns**:

   - **Local Security Risks**: Users are responsible for securing their own devices against malware, viruses, and physical theft. Failure to do so can lead to data breaches or loss.

   - **Data Privacy**: Storing sensitive information locally may raise concerns about unauthorized access or data leaks, especially if the device is shared or stolen.

   - **Lack of Compliance Controls**: Users may struggle to implement industry or regulatory compliance measures on their personal devices, potentially exposing them to legal or security risks.

In summary, the traditional computing approach can present challenges related to limited resources, difficulties in data access and synchronization, and security concerns that may be mitigated by adopting cloud-based or distributed computing solutions.
