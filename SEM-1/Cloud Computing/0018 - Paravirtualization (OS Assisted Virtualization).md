**1. Paravirtualization (OS Assisted Virtualization)**:

**Overview**:

Paravirtualization involves modifying the guest operating system to make it aware that it's running in a virtualized environment. The guest OS communicates directly with the hypervisor through a specialized API, bypassing certain operations that would normally require emulation or translation.

**Examples**:

- **Xen**: Xen is a popular open-source hypervisor that relies heavily on paravirtualization. It requires the guest operating system to be modified to use a special set of hypercalls.

**Pros**:

1. **Improved Performance**: Since the guest OS is aware of the virtualization layer, paravirtualization can achieve very high levels of performance and efficiency.

2. **Reduced Overhead**: By eliminating the need for certain virtualization overhead, paravirtualization can lead to better performance compared to full virtualization techniques.

3. **Better Resource Utilization**: Paravirtualized VMs can make more efficient use of system resources because they have direct communication with the hypervisor.

**Cons**:

1. **Guest OS Modification**: Requires modification of the guest OS, which means that not all operating systems are compatible with paravirtualization.

2. **Limited Guest OS Support**: Not all guest operating systems have been modified for paravirtualization, which can limit the choice of OS.

3. **Dependency on Hypervisor**: Guests modified for one hypervisor may not work on another, potentially leading to vendor lock-in.
