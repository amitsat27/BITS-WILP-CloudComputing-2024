In the OpenNebula architecture, the OpenNebula Core is a critical set of services and daemons responsible for the core functionality of the platform. It includes several key components that work together to manage virtualized resources efficiently. Among these components are the Request Manager, SQL Pool, VM Manager (Virtual Machine Manager), Host Manager, and VN Manager (Virtual Network Manager).

### 1. **Request Manager:**

- The Request Manager, also known as the OneGate service, handles user requests and external API calls. It acts as the gateway for user interactions with the OpenNebula infrastructure. The Request Manager processes requests, which can include actions like deploying virtual machines, managing storage, or modifying network configurations. It communicates with other components within the OpenNebula Core to execute these actions.

### 2. **SQL Pool:**

- The SQL Pool is responsible for managing the databases used by OpenNebula. It stores configuration information, user data, and the status of virtual machines and hosts. The SQL Pool ensures data consistency and integrity, allowing OpenNebula to maintain a centralized and reliable state of the cloud infrastructure.

### 3. **VM Manager (Virtual Machine Manager):**

- The VM Manager is a crucial component of the OpenNebula Core that interfaces with different hypervisors to manage the lifecycle of virtual machines. It communicates with hypervisors such as KVM, VMware, or Xen to perform actions such as virtual machine deployment, monitoring, migration, and termination. The VM Manager ensures coordination between the OpenNebula Core and the underlying virtualization infrastructure.

### 4. **Host Manager:**

- The Host Manager is responsible for managing the hosts (physical machines or hypervisors) in the OpenNebula infrastructure. It communicates with the OpenNebula Nodes running on each host to coordinate the deployment and execution of virtual machines. The Host Manager monitors the availability and status of hosts, ensuring efficient resource utilization and high availability.

### 5. **VN Manager (Virtual Network Manager):**

- The VN Manager is in charge of managing virtual networks within the OpenNebula environment. It handles the creation, modification, and deletion of virtual networks, including support for VLANs, VXLANs, and SDN configurations. The VN Manager ensures that virtual machines can communicate over the network according to the specified configurations.

### Summary:

The components within the OpenNebula Core work collaboratively to provide a comprehensive cloud management solution. The Request Manager acts as the interface for user requests and API calls, while the SQL Pool manages the databases to maintain the state of the cloud infrastructure. The VM Manager, Host Manager, and VN Manager coordinate the deployment and management of virtual machines, hosts, and virtual networks, respectively. Together, these components contribute to the efficient and reliable operation of OpenNebula.
