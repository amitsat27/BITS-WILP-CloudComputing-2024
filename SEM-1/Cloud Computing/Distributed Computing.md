**Distributed Computing**:

Distributed computing is a model in which multiple autonomous computers work together as a single system to achieve a common goal. This involves dividing a complex task into smaller subtasks that are distributed across multiple machines, which then work in parallel to complete the task.

**Details**:

1. **Communication**: Nodes in a distributed system communicate with each other through a network. This can be achieved via message passing or remote procedure calls.

2. **Fault Tolerance**: Distributed systems need to be resilient to failures. This involves redundancy, replication, and strategies for handling node or network failures.

3. **Synchronization**: Managing the order of operations across different nodes is crucial. Techniques like distributed locks or consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos or Raft) are used to ensure correctness.

4. **Data Distribution**: Data may be partitioned and distributed across nodes. Strategies like sharding and replication are used to ensure data availability and performance.

**Pros**:

1. **Scalability**: Distributed systems can handle large volumes of data and high processing loads by distributing tasks across multiple nodes.

2. **Fault Tolerance**: Redundancy and replication help ensure that the system can continue to operate even if individual nodes fail.

3. **Performance**: Parallel processing can lead to significant speed-up for tasks that can be divided into subtasks.

4. **Resource Utilization**: Distributed systems allow for efficient use of hardware resources by utilizing idle resources across the network.

**Cons**:

1. **Complexity**: Designing, implementing, and managing distributed systems is inherently more complex than single-node systems.

2. **Synchronization Overheads**: Ensuring consistency and correctness can introduce overhead due to the need for coordination and synchronization.

3. **Network Latency**: Communication over a network introduces latency, which can impact performance, especially for tasks that require frequent data exchange.

4. **Debugging and Testing**: Debugging and testing distributed systems can be challenging due to their inherent complexity and non-deterministic behavior.

**Examples**:

1. **Hadoop**: A popular open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets. It's widely used for tasks like batch processing, data warehousing, and more.

2. **Apache Spark**: Another open-source distributed computing system that focuses on in-memory processing. It's known for its speed and ease of use for tasks like data analytics and machine learning.

3. **Google File System (GFS)**: A distributed file system designed to provide efficient and reliable access to large datasets across clusters of machines.

4. **Amazon DynamoDB**: A managed NoSQL database service by AWS that provides seamless scalability and high availability across multiple data centers.

5. **Bitcoin Blockchain**: A distributed ledger technology where a network of nodes work together to validate and record transactions in a secure and immutable way.

6. **MapReduce**: The programming model and processing engine used in Hadoop for parallel processing of large datasets.

These examples showcase how distributed computing is applied in various domains, from data processing and storage to databases and blockchain technology.
