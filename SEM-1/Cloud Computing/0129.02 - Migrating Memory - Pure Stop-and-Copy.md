In the context of virtualization and memory migration, a "Pure Stop-and-Copy" approach refers to a method where the entire memory content of a virtual machine (VM) is stopped, copied to the destination host, and then the VM is resumed on the new host. This method involves a brief period of downtime during which the VM is not actively running. The process can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Pause the VM:**
   - Temporarily halt the execution of the VM, effectively pausing its operation.

2. **Copy Memory Contents:**
   - Copy the entire contents of the VM's memory to the destination host. This includes the state of the VM's RAM, registers, and other memory-related information.

3. **Transfer to Destination:**
   - Transfer the copied memory contents from the source host to the destination host. This step involves sending the memory data over the network.

4. **Resume Execution:**
   - Once the memory contents are successfully transferred to the destination host, resume the execution of the VM on the new host.

### Pros of Pure Stop-and-Copy Memory Migration:

1. **Simplicity:**
   - This approach is straightforward and relatively simple to implement compared to more complex live migration techniques.

2. **Complete Memory Copy:**
   - The entire memory state of the VM is copied, ensuring that no memory content is left behind, and the VM resumes its operation with a consistent state.

### Cons of Pure Stop-and-Copy Memory Migration:

1. **Downtime:**
   - One of the major drawbacks is the downtime experienced by the VM during the migration process. The VM is effectively paused, impacting its availability and disrupting ongoing operations.

2. **User Impact:**
   - Depending on the application and service requirements, the downtime experienced during memory migration may be unacceptable for certain use cases.

3. **Resource Intensiveness:**
   - The process can be resource-intensive, especially when dealing with large VMs or VMs with high memory utilization. The time required for memory copy and transfer can extend the downtime window.

4. **Limited to Certain Workloads:**
   - This approach may be more suitable for scenarios where short periods of downtime are acceptable and can be planned, such as during scheduled maintenance activities.

### Use Cases:

The Pure Stop-and-Copy memory migration approach might be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Small Workloads:**
  - For smaller VMs or workloads with minimal memory requirements where the downtime impact is acceptable.

- **Scheduled Maintenance:**
  - During planned maintenance windows when temporary VM downtime is acceptable.

- **Non-Critical Applications:**
  - For non-critical applications or services where brief interruptions are tolerable.

### Considerations:

- **Application Sensitivity:**
  - The suitability of this approach depends on the sensitivity of the applications and services running within the VM to downtime.

- **Planning and Coordination:**
  - To minimize user impact, migration activities using this approach should be well-planned and coordinated with stakeholders.

- **Resource Capacity:**
  - Ensure that both the source and destination hosts have sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network) to handle the migration process efficiently.

While the Pure Stop-and-Copy approach is simpler to implement, it's important to carefully assess the impact on the VM's availability and user experience, especially in environments where continuous operation is critical. In scenarios where minimal downtime is essential, alternative live migration techniques that aim to reduce or eliminate downtime might be preferred.
