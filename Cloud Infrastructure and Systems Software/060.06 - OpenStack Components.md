  - Integrates with storage backends for scalability.
  - Handles image versioning and sharing.
- **Use Case**: Managing and deploying virtual machine images.

---

### **7. Dashboard (Horizon)**
- **Purpose**: Provides a web-based user interface for managing OpenStack services.
- **Key Features**:
  - Simplified management of compute, storage, and networking.
  - Extensible for custom workflows and dashboards.
  - User-friendly GUI for both admins and users.

---

### **8. Orchestration (Heat)**
- **Purpose**: Automates the deployment of applications and infrastructure as code (IaC).
- **Key Features**:
  - Template-based orchestration using YAML files.
  - Manages dependencies and lifecycle of resources.
  - Scales resources dynamically.
- **Use Case**: Automating cloud deployments and managing infrastructure as code.

---

### **9. Telemetry (Ceilometer)**
- **Purpose**: Collects and monitors usage data for billing and performance monitoring.
- **Key Features**:
  - Aggregates data from other OpenStack services.
  - Provides APIs for metering and monitoring.
  - Useful for chargeback or resource optimization.
- **Use Case**: Billing, monitoring resource utilization, generating performance metrics.

---

### **10. Bare Metal Provisioning (Ironic)**
- **Purpose**: Provisions physical (bare-metal) servers instead of virtual instances.
- **Key Features**:
  - Provides hardware-level provisioning.
  - Integrates with Nova for managing bare-metal resources alongside VMs.
  - Useful for high-performance or dedicated workloads.
- **Use Case**: HPC workloads, databases, or performance-critical applications.

---

### **11. Shared File System (Manila)**
- **Purpose**: Provides shared file systems for applications.
- **Key Features**:
  - NFS and CIFS support for file sharing.
  - Multi-tenancy and user isolation.
  - Scalable file storage backend support.
- **Use Case**: Applications requiring shared file storage (e.g., web servers).

---

### **12. Key Management (Barbican)**
- **Purpose**: Manages secrets, encryption keys, and certificates.
- **Key Features**:
  - Secure key storage and retrieval.
  - Integration with other OpenStack services for encrypted volumes and data.
  - API-driven secret management.
- **Use Case**: Managing encryption keys for secure storage and communications.

---

### **13. Container Orchestration (Zun/Kuryr)**
- **Purpose**: Manages containers and integrates them with OpenStack services.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports Docker and other container runtimes.
  - Provides networking and storage for containers via Neutron and Cinder.
  - Integration with orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
- **Use Case**: Containerized application deployments.

---

### **14. Edge Computing (StarlingX)**
- **Purpose**: Optimizes OpenStack for edge computing environments.
- **Key Features**:
  - Lightweight and latency-sensitive.
  - Supports distributed workloads across edge locations.
  - Fault-tolerant and scalable.
- **Use Case**: IoT, 5G networks, real-time applications.

---

### **15. Workload Placement (Blazar)**
- **Purpose**: Manages resource reservations for future workloads.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reserves compute, storage, and networking resources.
  - Supports scheduled resource allocation.
- **Use Case**: Resource scheduling for predictable workloads.

---

### **16. DNS Service (Designate)**
- **Purpose**: Provides DNS as a service for applications and infrastructure.
- **Key Features**:
  - Manages DNS zones and records.
  - Integration with Neutron for auto-generated DNS.
  - API-based domain management.
- **Use Case**: Dynamic DNS configuration for cloud environments.

---

### **Component Relationships**
OpenStack’s components are modular and interact with each other to provide a complete cloud solution:
- **Nova** uses **Neutron** for networking and **Cinder** for storage.
- **Glance** stores images used by **Nova** to boot instances.
