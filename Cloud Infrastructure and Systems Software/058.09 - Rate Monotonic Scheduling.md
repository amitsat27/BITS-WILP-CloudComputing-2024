## **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** â€“ Overview

**Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** is a fixed-priority algorithm used for scheduling periodic tasks in real-time systems. It assigns priorities based on the task periods, with shorter periods receiving higher priorities. This algorithm is commonly used in real-time operating systems to ensure tasks meet their deadlines.

### **Details of Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)**

1. **Priority Assignment**: 
   - RMS assigns higher priorities to tasks with shorter periods.
   - The task with the smallest period has the highest priority.

2. **Preemptive**:
   - RMS is a **preemptive** scheduling algorithm, meaning that higher-priority tasks can preempt lower-priority tasks during execution.

3. **Static Priority**:
   - Priorities in RMS are **static**, meaning they do not change during execution. Once a task is assigned a priority, it remains fixed.

4. **Optimal**:
   - RMS is **optimal** for fixed-priority scheduling algorithms, meaning if a set of tasks can be scheduled by any fixed-priority scheduling algorithm, it can also be scheduled by RMS.

### **Pros and Cons of Rate Monotonic Scheduling**

#### **Pros:**
- **Simple to Implement and Understand**: RMS is easy to implement and understand, making it widely adopted in real-time systems.
- **Predictable Behavior**: The fixed priority system ensures that tasks with short periods will always be given priority, providing predictable scheduling behavior.
- **Optimal for Fixed-Priority Scheduling**: RMS is optimal for periodic task scheduling with fixed priorities.

#### **Cons:**
- **Limited CPU Utilization**: The CPU utilization in RMS has an upper bound of **$$n(2^{1/n} - 1)$$**, which means that for a large number of tasks, CPU utilization can be suboptimal.
- **Not Suitable for Dynamic Priorities**: RMS is not ideal for systems where tasks have dynamic priorities or tasks share resources.
- **Priority Inversion**: Priority inversion can occur in certain cases, where a higher-priority task is blocked by a lower-priority task due to resource sharing.

### **Numerical Example for Rate Monotonic Scheduling**

Given tasks **P1**, **P2**, and **P3**, with the following computation times and periods:

- **P1**: C = 3, T = 20
- **P2**: C = 2, T = 5
- **P3**: C = 2, T = 10

#### Step 1: Check Processor Utilization

The processor utilization \( U \) is calculated as:

```math
U = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{C_i}{T_i}
```

Substituting the values for each task:

```math
U = \frac{3}{20} + \frac{2}{5} + \frac{2}{10} = 0.15 + 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.75
```

Next, we calculate the **utilization bound** for **n = 3** tasks:

```math
U_{\text{bound}} = n(2^{1/n} - 1) = 3(2^{1/3} - 1) \approx 0.7977
```

Since the total utilization \( U = 0.75 \) is less than the utilization bound \( U_{\text{bound}} = 0.7977 \), the task set is schedulable.

#### Step 2: Calculate Scheduling Time

The **LCM (Least Common Multiple)** of the task periods (20, 5, 10) is:

```math
\text{LCM}(20, 5, 10) = 20 \, \text{time units}
```

This is the **scheduling cycle**.

#### Step 3: Priority Assignment

According to RMS, tasks with shorter periods have higher priority. Thus, the priority order is:

```math
P2 > P3 > P1
```

Where:
- **P2** has the shortest period (5) and highest priority,
- **P3** has the next shortest period (10) and second-highest priority,
- **P1** has the longest period (20) and lowest priority.

#### Step 4: Task Execution Sequence

Execution sequence:
0-2: P2 executes
2-4: P3 executes
4-5: P1 executes (1 unit)
5-7: P2 executes
7-9: P1 executes (2 units)
9-10: Idle
10-12: P2 executes
12-14: P3 executes
14-15: Idle
15-17: P2 executes
17-20: Idle

## **Conclusion**

- **Rate Monotonic Scheduling** provides predictable and optimal scheduling for periodic tasks in real-time systems with fixed priorities.
- It is simple and efficient but has limitations, including CPU utilization bounds and the risk of priority inversion.
