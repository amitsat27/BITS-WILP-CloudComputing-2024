---

### **1. Secure Design**
- AWS datacenters are built with robust physical and logical security measures. 
- This includes architecture designed to prevent unauthorized access, redundancy to avoid failure, and high-end security systems to protect data.

---

### **2. Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery**
- AWS ensures operations can continue even during unexpected events, such as natural disasters.
- Disaster recovery plans include backups, failover systems, and geographically distributed datacenters to prevent downtime.

---

### **3. Physical Access**
- Physical access to AWS datacenters is tightly controlled.
- Measures include biometric scans, security guards, surveillance cameras, and controlled access points to prevent unauthorized entry.

---

### **4. Monitoring & Logging**
- AWS uses advanced monitoring systems to track environmental factors (like temperature, humidity, and power) and system health.
- Logs are maintained to identify anomalies, security breaches, or performance issues.

---

### **5. Governance & Risk**
- AWS adheres to strict governance frameworks and industry compliance standards (like ISO, SOC, GDPR).
- Risk management strategies are applied to ensure data privacy and mitigate potential threats.

---

### **6. Infrastructure Maintenance**
- Regular maintenance is performed on the hardware and facilities to ensure reliable operation.
- This includes replacing aging equipment, maintaining cooling systems, and ensuring uninterrupted power supplies.

---

### **7. Operational Support Systems**
- These include tools and technologies to manage datacenter operations efficiently, such as inventory management systems, incident response tools, and operational dashboards.

---

### **8. Device Management**
- AWS ensures the proper configuration, maintenance, and decommissioning of devices like servers, storage systems, and network equipment.
- This also includes secure wiping or destruction of storage devices when they are no longer in use.

---

### **9. Surveillance & Detection**
- Continuous video surveillance and intrusion detection systems monitor the datacenters.
- AWS utilizes advanced technology like motion sensors and automated alarms to quickly identify and respond to threats.
