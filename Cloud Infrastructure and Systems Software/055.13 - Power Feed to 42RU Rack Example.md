To calculate the number of power feeds required to fully populate a 42U rack with **dual-corded 1RU servers**, we'll need to follow these steps:

### **Given Assumptions**:
1. **Power Factor (PF)**: 0.8
2. **Power Consumption of a 1RU Server**: 350W
3. **Rack Configuration**: 42U (Each unit of the rack has space for 1RU servers)
4. **Dual-Corded Servers**: Each server has two power cords, meaning it draws power from two different power feeds.

### **Step 1: Calculate Total Power Consumption for the 42U Rack**

For **1RU servers**:
- Power per 1RU server = **350W**.
- Number of 1RU servers in the 42U rack = **42 servers** (since 1U is a standard unit of height, and the rack has 42U).
- Total power consumption for all 42 servers (without considering redundancy or power factor yet) = 

```math
\text{Total Power} = 42 \times 350W = 14,700W
```

---

### **Step 2: Accounting for Power Factor**

Since the **power factor (PF)** is given as 0.8, we need to adjust for the **real power**:

```math
\text{Real Power} = \frac{\text{Apparent Power}}{\text{Power Factor}} = \frac{14,700W}{0.8} = 18,375W
```

So, the total **real power** requirement is **18,375W**.

### **Step 3: Determine the Power Capacity of Each Feed**

We’ll assume we are using **240V** single-phase power feeds (which is common for racks):

- **Power per feed** = Voltage × Current

Assuming we're using **20A feeds**, the power capacity per feed is:

```math
P_{\text{feed}} = 240V \times 20A = 4,800W
```

If using **30A feeds**, the power capacity per feed is:

```math
P_{\text{feed}} = 240V \times 30A = 7,200W
```

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the Number of Feeds Required**

Now, we calculate the number of feeds required based on the total real power needed.

#### **For 20A Feeds (4,800W per feed)**:
```math
\text{Number of Feeds} = \frac{\text{Real Power}}{\text{Power per Feed}} = \frac{18,375W}{4,800W} \approx 3.83
```

Since you can't have a fraction of a feed, **round up** to the nearest whole number:
```math
\text{Number of Feeds} = 4
```

#### **For 30A Feeds (7,200W per feed)**:
```math
\text{Number of Feeds} = \frac{\text{Real Power}}{\text{Power per Feed}} = \frac{18,375W}{7,200W} \approx 2.55
```

Again, rounding up:
```math
\text{Number of Feeds} = 3
```

---

### **Step 5: Accounting for Dual-Corded Servers**

Since each server is **dual-corded**, it is connected to two power feeds. Therefore, the number of power feeds needs to be doubled to account for this redundancy.

#### **For 20A Feeds**:
```math
\text{Number of Feeds (with dual cords)} = 4 \times 2 = 8
```

#### **For 30A Feeds**:
```math
\text{Number of Feeds (with dual cords)} = 3 \times 2 = 6
```

---

### **Final Answer**:

- If using **20A power feeds**, you will need **8 power feeds**.
- If using **30A power feeds**, you will need **6 power feeds**.

These calculations ensure that all servers are adequately powered, considering the dual-corded setup for redundancy.
