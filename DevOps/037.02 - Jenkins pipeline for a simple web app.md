Here’s an example of how you can create a **Jenkins pipeline** for a simple web app (such as a Node.js app) using a **Jenkinsfile**. The pipeline will automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application.

---

### **1. Setup Jenkins Pipeline**

The Jenkins pipeline consists of multiple stages, such as:

1. **Checkout the code** from the repository.
2. **Install dependencies**.
3. **Run tests**.
4. **Build** the application (e.g., package the app into a Docker image).
5. **Deploy** to a staging environment (this could be a Docker container or a Kubernetes cluster).

The **Jenkinsfile** is used to define this pipeline.

### **2. Example Jenkinsfile for a Simple Web App (Node.js)**

**Jenkinsfile** (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    environment {
        // Define any environment variables here
        DOCKER_IMAGE = "my-web-app"
        REGISTRY = "dockerhub"
        DEPLOYMENT_ENV = "staging"
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the latest code from the repository
                git 'https://github.com/username/my-web-app.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                // Install Node.js dependencies
                script {
                    sh 'npm install'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                // Run unit tests using npm (or any testing framework)
                script {
                    sh 'npm test'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                // Build a Docker image for the app
                script {
                    sh '''
                    docker build -t $DOCKER_IMAGE .
                    docker tag $DOCKER_IMAGE $REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE:latest
                    '''
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Push Docker Image') {
            steps {
                // Push Docker image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub)
                script {
                    sh 'docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME -p $DOCKER_PASSWORD'
                    sh 'docker push $REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE:latest'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Staging') {
            steps {
                // Deploy to staging (e.g., using Kubernetes or Docker)
                script {
                    sh '''
                    kubectl set image deployment/my-web-app my-web-app=$REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE:latest
                    kubectl rollout status deployment/my-web-app
                    '''
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Clean Up') {
            steps {
                // Clean up the environment, e.g., remove old Docker images
                script {
                    sh 'docker rmi $REGISTRY/$DOCKER_IMAGE:latest'
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            // Clean up or notify after all steps are completed
            echo 'Pipeline completed'
        }
        success {
            // Notify on success, e.g., Slack or email
            echo 'Deployment Successful!'
        }
        failure {
            // Notify on failure, e.g., Slack or email
            echo 'Deployment Failed!'
        }
    }
}
```

### **Explanation of the Jenkinsfile Stages**

1. **Checkout Code**:
   - This stage pulls the latest code from the Git repository using the `git` command. Replace the Git URL with your own repository URL.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - This stage installs the dependencies for the Node.js app using `npm install`.

3. **Run Tests**:
   - This stage runs unit tests using `npm test` (ensure you have tests defined in your `package.json`).

4. **Build Docker Image**:
   - This stage builds a Docker image for the application using a Dockerfile present in the root of the project. It tags the image with the name `my-web-app` and pushes it to the Docker registry.

5. **Push Docker Image**:
   - This stage logs in to Docker Hub (or another registry) using credentials (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) and pushes the built Docker image to the registry.

6. **Deploy to Staging**:
   - This stage deploys the Docker image to the **staging environment**. This example uses **Kubernetes** to set the image for the deployment and checks the status of the deployment.
   - If you're deploying to a non-Kubernetes environment (like a Docker server), this step would change accordingly.

7. **Clean Up**:
   - This stage cleans up any resources used in the pipeline, such as removing the Docker image from the local environment to free up space.

### **3. Example Dockerfile**

Here’s a basic **Dockerfile** for a Node.js app:

```Dockerfile
# Use official Node.js image as base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json for dependency installation
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the app's port (replace with your actual port)
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

### **4. Configure Jenkins**

1. **Create a New Job**:
   - In Jenkins, go to **New Item** and choose **Pipeline**.
   
2. **Configure Git Repository**:
   - Under **Pipeline** configuration, in the **Pipeline script from SCM** section, choose **Git** and provide the URL to your Git repository where the Jenkinsfile is located.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure that the Jenkins environment variables such as `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` are set in Jenkins credentials or in the pipeline script.

4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Click **Build Now** to trigger the pipeline and verify that each stage runs correctly. You can follow the progress in the **Console Output** section.

---

### **5. Additional Notes**

- **Docker Registry**: Ensure that your Docker Hub or custom Docker registry credentials are configured in Jenkins to push images.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: The example assumes you're deploying to a Kubernetes cluster. If you're using another method (like Docker Compose), the deployment step will differ.
- **Testing**: The test phase (`npm test`) assumes you have tests configured in your Node.js app. If you have a different framework, adjust accordingly.
- **Monitoring and Notifications**: You can integrate Jenkins with tools like Slack, Email, or other monitoring tools for notifications on success or failure.

This pipeline offers a simplified example of how Jenkins can be used for Continuous Deployment (CD) of a web application. You can expand this pipeline further to include features like canary deployments, automated rollbacks, or additional environments (e.g., production).
